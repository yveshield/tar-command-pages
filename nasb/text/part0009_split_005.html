            they
            told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Sisera summoned all his chariots, nine hundred

            down from
            <i class="calibre12">his</i> chariot and fled on foot.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as
            far as
            Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not even one was left.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Now
            Sisera
            fled on foot to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, because <i class="calibre12">there was</i>

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to
            him,
            &ldquo;Turn aside, my master, turn aside to me! Do not be afraid.&rdquo; So he turned aside to her into the
            tent,
            and she
            covered him with a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1149-1" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And he said to her, &ldquo;Please give me a
            little water to
            drink, for I am thirsty.&rdquo; So she opened a leather bottle of milk and gave him a drink; then she
            covered him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And he said to her, &ldquo;Stand in the doorway
            of the tent,
            and it shall be if anyone comes and inquires of you, and says, &lsquo;Is there anyone here?&rsquo; that you
            shall
            say,
            &lsquo;No.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But Jael, Heber&rsquo;s wife, took a tent peg
            and

            secretly to him and
            drove the peg into his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted.
            So he
            died.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And behold, while Barak was pursuing Sisera,
            Jael came
            out to meet him and said to him, &ldquo;Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.&rdquo; So he
            entered <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1149-3" epub:type="noteref"

            lying dead with the

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> So
            God
            subdued Jabin the king of Canaan on that day before the sons of Israel.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed
            harder and
            harder upon Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had eliminated Jabin the king of Canaan.
