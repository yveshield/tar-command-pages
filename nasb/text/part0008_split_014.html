  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel Is Circumcised</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about when all the kings of the Amorites who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> by the sea, heard how the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had dried up the waters of
    the Jordan before the sons of Israel until <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1037-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1037-1">a</a></sup></small>they had crossed, that their
    hearts melted, and there was no spirit in them any longer because of the sons of Israel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> At that time
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Joshua, &ldquo;Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise again the
    sons
    of Israel the second time.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Joshua made himself flint knives and circumcised the
    sons of Israel at <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1038-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1038-1">b</a></sup></small>Gibeath-haaraloth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the
    people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, died in the wilderness along the way after they
    came out of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For all the people who came out were circumcised, but
    all the people who were born in the wilderness along the way as they came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the
    wilderness, until all the nation, <i class="calibre12">that is,</i> the men of war who came out of Egypt, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1038-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1038-2">c</a></sup></small>perished because they did not listen to the voice of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, to whom the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had sworn that He would not let
    them see the land which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing
    with milk and honey.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So their children whom He raised up in their place,
    Joshua <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1038-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1038-3">d</a></sup></small>circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because
    they had not circumcised them along the way.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Now when they
    had finished circumcising all the nation, they remained in their places in the camp until they recovered.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
    Joshua, &ldquo;Today I have rolled away the shame of Egypt from you.&rdquo; So the name of that place is called
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1039-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1039-1">e</a></sup></small>Gilgal to this day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> While the
    sons of Israel camped at Gilgal they celebrated the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on
    the desert plains of Jericho.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then on the day after the Passover, on <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1040-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1040-1">f</a></sup></small>that very day, they ate some of the produce of the
    land, unleavened cakes and roasted <i class="calibre12">grain.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten
    some of the produce of the land, so that the sons of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate some of the yield of
    the land of Canaan during that year.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now it came
    about when Joshua was by Jericho, he raised his eyes and looked, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with
    his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, &ldquo;Are you for us or for our
    enemies?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>He said, &ldquo;No; rather I have come now <i
      class="calibre12">as</i> captain of the army of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo; And Joshua fell on
    his face
    to the ground, and bowed down, and said to him, &ldquo;What has my lord to say to his servant?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And the captain of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> army said to Joshua, &ldquo;Remove your sandals from
    your
    feet,
    for the place where you are standing is holy.&rdquo; And Joshua did so.
