  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Elkanah and His Wives</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now there was a man from Ramathaim-zophim from the hill
    country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph,
    an Ephraimite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And he had two wives: the name of one was Hannah and the
    name of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1265-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1265-1">a</a></sup></small>other Peninnah; and Peninnah had children, but
    Hannah had no children.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Now this man
    would go up from his city yearly to worship and to sacrifice to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies in
    Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were priests to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give
    portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>but to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he
    loved Hannah, but the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had closed her womb.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Her rival, moreover, would provoke her bitterly to
    irritate her, because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had closed her womb.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And it happened year after year, as often as she went up
    to the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, that she would provoke her; so she wept and would not eat.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Elkanah her husband would say to her,
    &ldquo;Hannah, why
    do you weep, and why do you not eat, and why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then Hannah
    got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat by the doorpost of the <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>She, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1266-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1266-2">c</a></sup></small>greatly
    distressed, prayed to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and wept bitterly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And she made a vow and said, &ldquo;L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> of armies, if You will indeed look on the affliction of Your bond-servant and remember
    me, and not forget Your bond-servant, but will give Your bond-servant a <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1266-3">d</a></sup></small>son, then I will give him to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> all the days of his life, and a razor shall never come on his head.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now it came
    about, as she <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1267-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1267-1">e</a></sup></small>continued praying before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, that Eli was watching her mouth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>As for Hannah, she was speaking in her heart, only her
    lips were quivering, but her voice was not heard. So Eli thought that she was drunk.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then Eli said to her, &ldquo;How long will you behave
    like a
    drunk? Get rid of your wine!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But Hannah answered and said, &ldquo;No, my lord, I am
    a
    woman <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1267-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1267-2">f</a></sup></small>despairing in spirit; I have drunk neither wine nor
    strong drink, but I have poured out my soul before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Do not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1267-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1267-3">g</a></sup></small>consider your
    bond-servant a useless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and provocation.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then Eli answered and said, &ldquo;Go in peace; and may
    the
    God of Israel grant your request that you have asked of Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>She said, &ldquo;Let your bond-servant find favor in
    your
    sight.&rdquo; So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer <i class="calibre12">sad.</i>

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samuel Is Born to Hannah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then they got up early in the morning and worshiped before
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and returned again to their house in Ramah. And Elkanah <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>It came about <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1268-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1268-2">i</a></sup></small>in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she
    gave birth to a son; and she named him Samuel, <i class="calibre12">saying,</i> &ldquo;Because I have asked for him
    of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then the man
    Elkanah went up with all his household to offer to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> the yearly sacrifice and <i
      class="calibre12">to pay</i> his vow.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband,
    &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">I will not go</i> until the child is weaned; then I will bring him, so that he may
    appear
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and stay there for life.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Elkanah her husband said to her, &ldquo;Do <small

    until
    she weaned him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her,
    with a three-year-old bull, one ephah of flour, and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And she said, &ldquo;Pardon me, my lord! As your soul
    lives,
    my lord, I am the woman who stood here beside you, praying to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>For this boy I prayed, and the L<span
