  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Ark Returned to Israel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had been
    in the territory of the Philistines for seven months.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the Philistines called for the priests and the
    diviners, saying, &ldquo;What are we to do with the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>? Tell us <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1287-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1287-1">a</a></sup></small>how we may send it to its place.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And they said, &ldquo;If you are going to send the ark
    of the
    God of Israel away, do not send it empty; but you shall certainly return to Him a guilt offering. Then you will be
    healed, and it will be revealed to you why His hand does not leave you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then they said, &ldquo;What is to be the guilt offering
    that
    we shall return to Him?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Five gold tumors and five gold mice <i
      class="calibre12">corresponding
      to</i> the number of the governors of the Philistines, since one plague was on all of <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1287-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1287-2">b</a></sup></small>you and on your governors.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So you shall make likenesses of your tumors and
    likenesses of your mice that are ruining the land, and you shall give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will
    lighten His hand from you, your gods, and your land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Why then do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and
    Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them, did they not let <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1287-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1287-3">c</a></sup></small>the people go, and they left?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milk cows
    on which there has never been a yoke; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves back home, away from
    them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then take the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and place it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you return to Him as a
    guilt offering in a saddlebag by its side. Then send it away that it may go.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But watch: if it goes up by the way of its own territory
    to Beth-shemesh, then He has done this great evil to us. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that
    struck us; it happened to us by chance.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then the men
    did so: they took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and shut in their calves at home.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And they put the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> on the cart, and the saddlebag with the gold mice and the likenesses of their tumors.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Now the cows went straight in the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1288-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1288-1">d</a></sup></small>direction of Beth-shemesh; they went on the same
    road, bellowing as they went, and did not turn off to the right or to the left. And the governors of the Philistines
    followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now <i
      class="calibre12">the people of</i> Beth-shemesh were gathering in their wheat harvest in the valley, and they
    raised their eyes and saw the ark, and rejoiced at seeing <i class="calibre12">it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And the cart came into the field of Joshua the
    Beth-shemite and stopped there where there <i class="calibre12">was</i> a large stone; and they split the wood of
    the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And the Levites took down the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and the saddlebag that was with it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on
    the large stone; and the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices that day to the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>When the five governors of the Philistines saw <i
      class="calibre12">it,</i> they returned to Ekron that day.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Now these are
    the gold tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>: one for
    Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, <i class="calibre12">and</i> one for Ekron;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>and the gold mice, <i
      class="calibre12">corresponding</i> to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five
    governors, both of fortified cities and of country villages. The large <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1289-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1289-1">e</a></sup></small>stone on which they placed the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <i class="calibre12">is a witness</i> to this day in the field of Joshua the
    Beth-shemite.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Now He
    fatally struck some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>. He struck 50,070 men among the people, and the people mourned because the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had struck the people with a great slaughter.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And the men of Beth-shemesh said, &ldquo;Who is able to
    stand
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, this holy God? And to whom will He go up from us?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So they sent messengers to the inhabitants of
    Kiriath-jearim, saying, &ldquo;The Philistines have brought back the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>;
    come
    down and take it up to yourselves.&rdquo;
