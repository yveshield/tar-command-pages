    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> It is the same
    for all. There is one fate for the righteous and for the wicked; for the good, for the clean and the unclean; for
    the person who offers a sacrifice and for the one who does not sacrifice. As the good person is, so is the sinner;
    the one who swears <i class="calibre12">an oath</i> is just as the one who <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>This is an evil in everything that is done under the
    sun, that there is one fate for everyone. Furthermore, the hearts of the sons of mankind are full of evil, and
    insanity is in their hearts throughout their lives. Afterward <i class="calibre12">they go</i> to the dead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For whoever is joined to all the living, there is hope;
    for better a live dog, than a dead lion.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For the living know that they will die; but the dead do
    not know anything, nor do they have a reward any longer, for their memory is forgotten.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Indeed their love, their hate, and their zeal have
    already perished, and they will no longer have a share in all that is done under the sun.

    already approved your works.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>See that your clothes are white all the time, and that
    there is no lack of oil on your head.

    under the sun that the race is not to the swift and the battle is not to the warriors, and neither is bread to the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>For indeed, a person does not know his time: like fish

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>there was a small city with few men in it, and a great
    king came to it, surrounded it, and constructed large siegeworks against it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But there was found in it a poor wise man, and he
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4168-2" epub:type="noteref"

    that poor man.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So I said, &ldquo;Wisdom is better than
    strength.&rdquo; But
    the
    wisdom of the poor man is despised, and his words are <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source4168-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0021_split_022.html#f4168-3">i</a></sup></small>ignored.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>The words of the wise heard in calm are <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Wisdom is better than weapons of war, but one sinner
    destroys much good.
