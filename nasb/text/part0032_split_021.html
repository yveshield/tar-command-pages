  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Healing the Man Born Blind</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> As <i class="calibre12">Jesus</i> passed by, He saw a man <i
      class="calibre12">who had been</i> blind from birth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And His disciples asked Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, who sinned,
    this
    man or his parents, that he would be born blind?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">It was</i>
    neither
    <i class="calibre12">that</i> this man sinned, nor his parents; but <i class="calibre12">it was</i> so that the
    works of God might be displayed in him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>We must carry out the works of Him who sent Me as long
    as it is day; night is coming, when no one can work.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>While I am in the world, I am the Light of the
    world.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>When He had said this, He spit on the ground, and made
    mud from the saliva, and applied the mud to his eyes,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>and said to him, &ldquo;Go, wash in the pool of
    Siloam&rdquo;
    (which
    is translated, Sent). So he left and washed, and came <i class="calibre12">back</i> seeing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So the neighbors, and those who previously saw <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6567-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6567-1">a</a></sup></small>him as a beggar, were saying, &ldquo;Is this not the
    one
    who used to sit and beg?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Others were saying, &ldquo;This is he,&rdquo; <i
      class="calibre12">still</i> others were saying, &ldquo;No, but he is like him.&rdquo; <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6567-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6567-2">b</a></sup></small>The man himself kept saying, &ldquo;I am <i
      class="calibre12">the one.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So they were saying to him, &ldquo;How then were your
    eyes
    opened?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>He answered, &ldquo;The man who is called Jesus made
    mud, and
    spread <i class="calibre12">it</i> on my eyes, and said to me, &lsquo;Go to Siloam and wash&rsquo;; so I went away
    and
    washed,
    and I received sight.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And they said to him, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo; He
    *said,
    &ldquo;I do
    not know.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Controversy over the Man</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> They *brought <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6568-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6568-1">c</a></sup></small>the man who
    was previously blind to the Pharisees.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Now it was a Sabbath on the day that Jesus made the mud
    and opened his eyes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then the Pharisees also were asking him again how he
    received his sight. And he said to them, &ldquo;He applied mud to my eyes, and I washed, and I see.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying,
    &ldquo;This man
    is not from God, because He does not keep the Sabbath.&rdquo; But others were saying, &ldquo;How can a man who is a
    sinner
    perform such <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6568-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6568-2">d</a></sup></small>signs?&rdquo; And there was dissension among them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So they *said again to the man who was blind,
    &ldquo;What do
    you say about Him, since He opened your eyes?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;He is a prophet.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> The Jews then
    did not believe <i class="calibre12">it</i> about him, that he had been blind and had received sight, until they
    called the parents of the very one who had received his sight,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>and they questioned them, saying, &ldquo;Is this your
    son,
    who you say was born blind? Then how does he now see?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>His parents then answered and said, &ldquo;We know that
    this
    is our son, and that he was born blind;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>but how he now sees, we do not know; or who opened his
    eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>His parents said this because they were afraid of the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6569-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6569-1">e</a></sup></small>Jews; for the Jews had already reached the decision
    that if anyone confessed Him to be <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6569-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6569-2">f</a></sup></small>Christ, he was to be
    excommunicated from the synagogue.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small><i class="calibre12">It was</i> for this reason <i
      class="calibre12">that</i> his parents said, &ldquo;He is of age; ask him.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> So for a
    second time they summoned the man who had been blind, and said to him, &ldquo;Give glory to God; we know that this
    man is
    a sinner.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>He then answered, &ldquo;Whether He is a sinner, I do
    not
    know; one thing I do know, that though I was blind, now I see.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>So they said to him, &ldquo;What did He do to you? How
    did He
    open your eyes?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>He answered them, &ldquo;I told you already and you did
    not
    listen; why do you want to hear <i class="calibre12">it</i> again? You do not want to become His disciples too, do
    you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>They spoke abusively to him and said, &ldquo;You are
    His
    disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>We know that God has spoken to Moses, but as for this
    man, we do not know where He is from.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>The man answered and said to them, &ldquo;Well, here is
    the
    amazing thing, that you do not know where He is from, and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> He opened my eyes!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>We know that God does not listen to sinners; but if
    someone is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6570-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6570-1">g</a></sup></small>God-fearing and does His will, He listens to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6570-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6570-2">h</a></sup></small>Since the
    beginning of time it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a person born blind.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>If this man were not from God, He could do
    nothing.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>They answered him, &ldquo;You were born entirely in
    sins, and
    <i class="calibre12">yet</i> you are teaching us?&rdquo; So they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6570-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6570-3">i</a></sup></small>put him out.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Jesus said to him, &ldquo;You have both seen Him, and

    the one who is talking with you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;I believe, Lord.&rdquo; And he
    worshiped
    Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>And Jesus said, &ldquo;For judgment I came into this
    world,
    so that those who do not see may see, and those who see may become blind.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>Those who were with Him from the Pharisees heard these
    things and said to Him, &ldquo;We are not blind too, are we?&rdquo;
