    officers of the king, along with ten men, came to Mizpah to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. While they were eating bread
    together there in Mizpah,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the ten men who were
    with him rose up, and struck and killed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, with the sword and put to
    death the one whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Ishmael also struck and killed all the Jews who were
    with him, <i class="calibre12">that is</i> with Gedaliah in Mizpah, and the Chaldeans who were found there, the men
    of war.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Now it

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then Ishmael the son of Nethaniah left Mizpah to meet
    them, weeping as he went; and as he met them, he said to them, &ldquo;Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Yet it turned out that as soon as they came inside the
    city, Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and the men who were with him slaughtered them <i class="calibre12">and threw

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But ten men who were found among them said to Ishmael,
    &ldquo;Do not put us to death, for we have supplies of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the field.&rdquo; So
    he
    refrained
    and did not put them to death along with their companions.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Now as for the

    had constructed on account of Baasha, king of Israel; Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the dead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people
    who were in Mizpah, the king&rsquo;s daughters and all the people who were left in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the
    captain of
    the bodyguard had put in the custody of Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. Ishmael the son of Nethaniah took them captive
    and proceeded to cross over to the sons of Ammon.
