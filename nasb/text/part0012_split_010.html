          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1672-4">d</a></sup></small>life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah;
    and he left his servant there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But he himself went a day&rsquo;s journey into the
    wilderness,
    and came and sat down under a broom tree; and he asked for himself to die, and said, &ldquo;Enough! Now, L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then he lay down and fell asleep under a broom tree; but
    behold, there was an angel touching him, and he said to him, &ldquo;Arise, eat!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a round
    loaf of bread <i class="calibre12">baked on</i> hot coals, and a pitcher of water. So he ate and drank, and lay down
    again.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>But the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    came back a second time and touched him, and said, &ldquo;Arise, eat; because the journey is too long for
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So he arose and ate and drank, and he journeyed in the
    strength of that food for forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mountain of God.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Elijah at Horeb</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then he came there to a cave and spent the night there; and
    behold, the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> <i class="calibre12">came</i> to him, and He said to him,
    &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant, torn down
    Your
    altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they have sought to take my life.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> So He said,
    &ldquo;Go out and stand on the mountain before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo; And behold, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was passing by! And a great and powerful wind was tearing out the mountains and breaking
    the rocks in pieces before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; <i class="calibre12">but</i> the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <i class="calibre12">was</i> not in the wind. And after the wind <i
      class="calibre12">there was</i> an earthquake, <i class="calibre12">but</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    <i class="calibre12">was</i> not in the earthquake.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And after the earthquake, a fire, <i
      class="calibre12">but</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> <i class="calibre12">was</i> not in the fire; and
    after the fire, a sound of a gentle blowing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>When Elijah heard <i class="calibre12">it,</i> he
    wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood in the entrance of the cave. And behold, a voice <i
      class="calibre12">came</i> to him and said, &ldquo;What are you doing here, Elijah?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;I have been very zealous for the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of armies; for the sons of Israel have abandoned Your covenant, torn down
    Your
    altars, and killed Your prophets with the sword. And I alone am left; and they have sought to take my life.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> said to him, &ldquo;Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus; and when you
    have
    arrived, you shall anoint Hazael king over Aram.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>You shall also anoint Jehu the son of Nimshi king over
    Israel; and you shall anoint Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah as prophet in your place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And it shall come about that the one who escapes from
    the sword of Hazael, Jehu shall put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu, Elisha shall put to
    death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the
    knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> So he
    departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat while he was plowing, with twelve yoke <i
      class="calibre12">of oxen</i> in front of him, and he with the twelfth. And Elijah came over to him and threw his
    cloak on him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then he left the oxen behind and ran after Elijah, and
    said, &ldquo;Please let me kiss my father and my mother, then I will follow you.&rdquo; And he said to him,
    &ldquo;Go
    back, for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1673-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1673-1">f</a></sup></small>what have I done to you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So he returned from following him, and took the pair of
    oxen and sacrificed them, and cooked their meat with the implements of the oxen, and gave <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> to the people and they ate. Then he got up and followed Elijah and served him.
