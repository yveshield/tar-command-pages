    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Abraham was old, advanced in age; and the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his household
    who was in charge of all that he owned, &ldquo;Please place your hand under my thigh,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and I will make you swear by the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son from
    the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and
    take a wife for my son Isaac.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>The servant said to him, &ldquo;Suppose the woman is not
    willing to follow me to this land; should I take your son back to the land from where you came?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then Abraham said to him, &ldquo;Beware that you do not
    take
    my son back there!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of heaven,
    who took me from my father&rsquo;s house and from the land of my birth, and who spoke to me and who swore to me,
    saying,
    &lsquo;To your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source96-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f96-1">a</a></sup></small>descendants I will give this land&rsquo;—He will send
    His
    angel ahead of you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But if the woman is not willing to follow you, then you
    will be free of this oath of mine; only do not take my son back there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So the servant placed his hand under the thigh of his
    master Abraham, and swore to him concerning this matter.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then the
    servant took ten camels from the camels of his master, and went out with a variety of good things of his

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Rebekah Is Chosen</i></p>

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> And it came about, before he had finished speaking, that
    behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah, the wife of Abraham&rsquo;s brother Nahor, came out with
    her
    jar on her shoulder.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>The young woman was very beautiful, a virgin; no man

    filled her jar, and came up.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then the servant ran to meet her, and said,
    &ldquo;Please let
    me drink a little water from your jar.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And she said, &ldquo;Drink, my lord&rdquo;; then she
    quickly
    lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now when she had finished giving him a drink, she said,
    &ldquo;I will also draw <i class="calibre12">water</i> for your camels until they have finished drinking.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran
    back to the well to draw, and she drew for all his camels.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Meanwhile, the man was taking a close look at her
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source98-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> When the
    camels had finished drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>and he said, &ldquo;Whose daughter are you? Please tell
    me,
    is there room for us to stay overnight at your father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>She said to him, &ldquo;I am the daughter of Bethuel,
    Milcah&rsquo;s son, whom she bore to Nahor.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Again she said to him, &ldquo;We have plenty of both
    straw
    and feed, and room to stay overnight.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then the man bowed low and worshiped the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Blessed be the L<span

    trustworthiness toward my master; as for me, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has guided me in the way to the
    house of my master&rsquo;s brothers.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Then the
    young woman ran and told her mother&rsquo;s household about these things.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and
    Laban ran outside to the man at the spring.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his

          href="part0003_split_017.html#f100-2">l</a></sup></small>This is what the man said to me,&rdquo; he went to
    the man;
    and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Come in, blessed of the L<span

    camels?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>So the man entered the house. Then <small

          href="part0003_split_017.html#f100-3">m</a></sup></small>Laban unloaded the camels, and he gave straw and feed
    to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>But when <i class="calibre12">food</i> was set before
    him to eat, he said, &ldquo;I will not eat until I have stated my business.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Speak
    on.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>So he said, &ldquo;I am Abraham&rsquo;s servant.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>My master made me swear, saying, &lsquo;You shall not

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>Then I said to my master, &lsquo;Suppose the woman does
    not

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>And he said to me, &lsquo;The L<span
