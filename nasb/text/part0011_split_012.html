    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>For the battle there was spread over the whole
    countryside, and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword devoured.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Now Absalom
    encountered the servants of David. Absalom was riding on <i class="calibre12">his</i> mule, and the mule went under

    informed Joab and said, &ldquo;Behold, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak.&rdquo;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And ten young men who carried Joab&rsquo;s armor
    gathered
    around and struck Absalom and killed him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then Joab
    blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab restrained the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And they took Absalom and threw him into <small

    very large pile of stones. And all Israel fled, each to his <i class="calibre12">own</i> tent.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for
    himself a memorial stone, which is in the King&rsquo;s Valley, for he said, &ldquo;I have no son to <small

          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1502-2">o</a></sup></small>continue my name.&rdquo; So he named the memorial
    stone
    after his own name, and it is called Absalom&rsquo;s Monument to this day.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But Joab said to him, &ldquo;You are not the man <i

    news this day, because the king&rsquo;s son is dead.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then Joab said to the Cushite, &ldquo;Go, tell the king
    what
    you have seen.&rdquo; So the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>However, Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said once more to
    Joab, &ldquo;But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.&rdquo; And Joab said, &ldquo;Why would

    run, my son,
    since you will have no messenger&rsquo;s reward for going?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>&ldquo;But whatever happens,&rdquo; <i

      said,</i> &ldquo;I will run.&rdquo; So he said to him, &ldquo;Run.&rdquo; Then Ahimaaz ran by way of the plain and
    passed by
    the Cushite.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Now David was
    sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went to the roof of the gate by the wall, and raised his eyes and
    looked; and behold, a man was running by himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So the watchman called out and told the king. And the
    king said, &ldquo;If he is by himself there is good news in his mouth.&rdquo; And he came nearer and nearer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then the watchman saw another man running; and the
    watchman called to the gatekeeper and said, &ldquo;Behold, <i class="calibre12">another</i> man is running by
    himself.&rdquo;
    And the king said, &ldquo;This one also is bringing good news.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>The watchman said, &ldquo;I <small class="small1"><sup

    running form of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;This is a good man, and he is coming with
    good
    news.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Then Ahimaaz
    called out and said to the king, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1505-1"

    prostrated
    himself before the king with his face to the ground. And he said, &ldquo;Blessed is the L<span

    your God, who has turned over the men who raised their hands against my lord the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>But the king said, &ldquo;Is it well with the young man
    Absalom?&rdquo; And Ahimaaz answered, &ldquo;When Joab sent the king&rsquo;s servant, and your servant, I saw a

    did not know what <i class="calibre12">it was.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Then the king said, &ldquo;Turn aside and stand

    turned aside and stood still.

    the Cushite arrived, and the Cushite said, &ldquo;Let my lord the king receive good news, for the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Then the king said to the Cushite, &ldquo;Is it well
    with the
    young man Absalom?&rdquo; And the Cushite answered, &ldquo;May the enemies of my lord the king, and all who rise up
    against you
    for evil, be like <i class="calibre12">that</i> young man!&rdquo;
