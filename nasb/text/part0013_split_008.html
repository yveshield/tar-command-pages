    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And he built altars in the house of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>He built altars for all the heavenly <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And he made his son pass through the fire, interpreted
    signs, practiced divination, and used mediums and spiritists. He did great evil in the sight of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he put the carved image of Asherah that he had made
    in the house of which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had said to David and to his son Solomon, &ldquo;In this
    house
    and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And I will not make the feet of Israel wander anymore
    from the land which I gave their fathers, if only they will take care to act in accordance with everything that I
    have commanded them, and with all the Law that My servant Moses commanded them.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But they did not listen, and Manasseh encouraged them to
    do evil, more than the nations whom the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> eliminated from the presence of the sons of
    Israel.

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke through His
    servants the prophets, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>&ldquo;Since Manasseh king of Judah has committed these
    abominations, having done more evil than all that the Amorites did who <i class="calibre12">were</i> before him, and
    has also misled Judah into sin with his idols,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>therefore this is what the L<span

    disaster
    on Jerusalem and Judah that whoever hears about it, both of his ears will ring.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria and
    the plummet of the house of Ahab, and I will wipe Jerusalem clean just as one wipes a bowl, wiping it and turning it
    upside down.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And I will abandon the remnant of My inheritance and
    hand them over to their enemies, and they will become as plunder and spoils to all their enemies,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>because they have done evil in My sight, and have been
    provoking Me to anger since the day their fathers came from Egypt, even to this day.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Furthermore,
    Manasseh shed very much innocent blood until he had filled Jerusalem <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>He did evil in the sight of the L<span

    the God of his fathers, and did not walk in the way of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.

    killed the king in his own house.

    Amon, and the people of the land made his son Josiah king in his place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they
    not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?
