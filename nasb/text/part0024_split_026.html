  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span

    Nebuchadnezzar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Now at that time the army of the king of Babylon was
    besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard, which <i
      class="calibre12">was at</i> the house of the king of Judah,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>because Zedekiah king of Judah had imprisoned him,
    saying, &ldquo;Why do you prophesy, saying, &lsquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says:
    &ldquo;Behold,
    I am going
    to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will take it;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>and Zedekiah king of Judah will not escape from the hand
    of the Chaldeans, but he will certainly be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will speak with him <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then he will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and he will be
    there until I visit him,&rdquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. &ldquo;If you fight against the
    Chaldeans,
    you
    will not succeed&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And Jeremiah
    said, &ldquo;The word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&lsquo;Behold, Hanamel the son of Shallum your uncle is

    to you, saying, &ldquo;Buy for yourself my field which is at Anathoth, for you have the right of redemption to buy
    <i class="calibre12">it.</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then my uncle&rsquo;s son Hanamel came to me in the
    courtyard
    of the guard in accordance with the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and said to me, &lsquo;Buy my
    field,
    please, that is at Anathoth, which is in the land of Benjamin; for you have the right of possession and the
    redemption is yours; buy <i class="calibre12">it</i> for yourself.&rsquo; Then I knew that this was the word of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> &ldquo;So I
    bought
    the field which was in Anathoth from Hanamel my uncle&rsquo;s son, and I weighed out the silver for him, seventeen
    shekels

    sealed the deed, and called in witnesses, and weighed out the silver on the scales.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then I took the deeds of purchase, both the sealed <i
      class="calibre12">copy containing</i> the terms and conditions and the open <i class="calibre12">copy;</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of
    Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, in the sight of Hanamel my uncle&rsquo;s <i class="calibre12">son</i> and in the sight
    of the
    witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, in the sight of all the Jews who were sitting in the courtyard of the
    guard.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And I commanded Baruch in their sight, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>&lsquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> of
    armies, the God of Israel says: &ldquo;Take these deeds, this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put
    them in
    an earthenware jar, so that they may <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4981-2"

    Yourself, as at this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>You brought Your people Israel out of the land of Egypt
    with signs and with wonders, and with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, and with great terror;

    forefathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>They came in and took possession of it, but they did
    not obey Your voice or walk in Your Law; they did not do <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    You commanded them to do; therefore You have made all this disaster happen to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Behold, the assault ramps have reached the city to take
    it; and the city has been handed over to the Chaldeans who fight against it, because of the sword, the famine, and
    the plague; and what You have spoken has come to pass; and behold, You see <i class="calibre12">it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Yet You have said to me, Lord <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>They have turned <i class="calibre12">their</i> back to

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>They built the high places of Baal that are in the
