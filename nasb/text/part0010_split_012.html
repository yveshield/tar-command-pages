  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samuel Goes to Bethlehem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Samuel,
    &ldquo;How
    long are you going to mourn for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1334-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1334-1">a</a></sup></small>Saul, since I have rejected him
    from being king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, because I
    have chosen a king for Myself among his sons.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But Samuel said, &ldquo;How can I go? When Saul hears <i
      class="calibre12">about it,</i> he will kill me.&rdquo; But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said, &ldquo;Take
    a
    heifer
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1334-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1334-2">b</a></sup></small>with you and say, &lsquo;I have come to sacrifice to
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And you shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will
    let you know what you shall do; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1334-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1334-3">c</a></sup></small>designate to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Samuel did what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    told <i class="calibre12">him,</i> and he came to Bethlehem. Then the elders of the city came trembling to meet him
    and said, &ldquo;Do you come in peace?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;In peace; I have come to sacrifice
    to the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.&rdquo; He also
    consecrated
    Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> When they
    entered, he looked at Eliab and thought, &ldquo;Surely the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span>
    anointed is <i class="calibre12">standing</i> before Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Samuel,
    &ldquo;Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him; for <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1335-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1335-1">d</a></sup></small>God does not <i class="calibre12">see</i> as man
    sees, since man looks at <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1335-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1335-2">e</a></sup></small>the outward appearance, but the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> looks at the heart.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before
    Samuel. But he said, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has not chosen this one, either.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Next Jesse had <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1335-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1335-3">f</a></sup></small>Shammah pass by. And he said, &ldquo;The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has not chosen this one, either.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But
    Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has not chosen these.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then Samuel said to Jesse, &ldquo;Are these all the
    boys?&rdquo;
    And he said, &ldquo;The youngest is still left, but behold, he is tending the sheep.&rdquo; So Samuel said to Jesse,
    &ldquo;Send <i class="calibre12">word</i> and bring him; for we will not take our places at the table until he comes
    here.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Anointed</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So he sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and brought
    him in. Now he was <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1336-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1336-1">g</a></sup></small>reddish, with beautiful eyes and a handsome
    appearance. And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said, &ldquo;Arise, anoint him; for this is he.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the
    midst of his brothers; and the Spirit of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> rushed upon David from that day
    forward. And Samuel set out and went to Ramah.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Now the
    Spirit of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> left Saul, and an evil spirit from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> terrified him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Saul&rsquo;s servants then said to him, &ldquo;Behold
    now, an
    evil
    spirit from God is terrifying you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>May our lord now command your servants who are before
    you. Have them search for a man who is a skillful musician on the harp; and it shall come about whenever the evil
    spirit from God is upon you, that he shall play <i class="calibre12">the harp</i> with his hand, and you will become
    well.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So Saul said to his servants, &ldquo;Now select for me
    a man
    who can play well, and bring <i class="calibre12">him</i> to me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then one of the young men responded and said,
    &ldquo;Behold,
    I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a valiant mighty man, a warrior, skillful in
    speech, and a handsome man; and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is with him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So Saul sent messengers to Jesse <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1337-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1337-1">h</a></sup></small>to say, &ldquo;Send me your son David, who is with
    the
    flock.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And Jesse took a donkey <i class="calibre12">loaded
      with</i> bread and a jug of wine, and <i class="calibre12">he took</i> a young goat, and sent <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> to Saul by his son David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then David came to Saul and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1337-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1337-2">i</a></sup></small>attended him; and <i class="calibre12">Saul</i>
    greatly loved him, and he became his armor bearer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So Saul sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> to Jesse,
    saying, &ldquo;Let David now <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1337-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1337-3">j</a></sup></small>be my attendant for he has found favor in my
    sight.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So it came about whenever the <i
      class="calibre12">evil</i> spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the harp and play <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> with his hand; and Saul would feel relieved and become well, and the evil spirit would
    leave him.
