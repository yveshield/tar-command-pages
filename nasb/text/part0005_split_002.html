  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> &lsquo;Now when anyone presents a grain offering as an
    offering to
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour oil on it and put
    frankincense on it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He shall then bring it to Aaron&rsquo;s sons the
    priests; and
    he shall take from it his handful of its fine flour and of its oil, with all of its frankincense. And the priest
    shall offer <i class="calibre12">it</i> up in smoke <i class="calibre12">as</i> its memorial portion on the altar,
    an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and
    his sons: a most holy part of the offerings to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by fire.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> &lsquo;Now
    when you
    bring an offering of a grain offering baked in an oven, <i class="calibre12">it shall be</i> unleavened cakes of
    fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source492-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f492-1">a</a></sup></small>spread with oil.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And if your offering is a grain offering <i
      class="calibre12">made</i> on the griddle, <i class="calibre12">it shall be</i> of fine flour, unleavened, mixed
    with oil;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>you shall break it into bits and pour oil on it; it is a
    grain offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now if your offering is a grain offering <i
      class="calibre12">made</i> in a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source492-2"

    flour with oil.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When you bring in the grain offering which is made of
    these things to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to
    the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>The priest then shall take up from the grain offering
    its memorial portion, and shall offer <i class="calibre12">it</i> up in smoke on the altar <i
      class="calibre12">as</i> an offering by fire of a soothing aroma to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The remainder of the grain offering belongs to Aaron
    and his sons: a most holy part of the offerings to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by fire.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> &lsquo;No
    grain
    offering, which you bring to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, shall be made with leaven, for you shall not
    offer <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source493-1" epub:type="noteref"

    fire to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>As an offering of first fruits you shall bring them to
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, but they shall not ascend as a soothing aroma on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Every grain offering of yours, moreover, you shall
    season with salt, so that the salt of the covenant of your God will not be lacking from your grain offering; with
    all your offerings you shall offer salt.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> &lsquo;Also
    if you
    bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, you shall bring fresh heads
    of grain roasted in the fire, crushed grain of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened produce.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>You shall then put oil on it and place incense on it;
    it is a grain offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then the priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial
    portion, part of its crushed grain and its oil with all its incense as an offering by fire to the L<span
