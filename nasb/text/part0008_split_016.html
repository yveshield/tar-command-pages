            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully regarding
            the things

            of
            Judah, took some of the designated things; therefore the anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
            burned
            against the sons of Israel.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> Now
            Joshua

            the men went up and
            spied out Ai.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then they returned to Joshua and said to him,

            do not trouble all the people there, for they are few.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So about three thousand men from the people went
            up
            there, but they fled <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1045-2" epub:type="noteref"

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then
            Joshua

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So
