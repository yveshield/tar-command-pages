  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Moses,
    saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp in
    front
    of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea; you shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For Pharaoh will say of the sons of Israel, &lsquo;They
    are
    wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.&rsquo;

    them;
    and I will be honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians will know that I am the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> When the king
    of Egypt was told that the people had fled, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source327-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_000.html#f327-1">b</a></sup></small>Pharaoh and his servants had a

    have let Israel go from serving us?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So he had <i class="calibre12">horses</i> harnessed <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then the Egyptians chased after them <i

    army, and they overtook them camping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> As Pharaoh
    approached, the sons of Israel <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source328-1" epub:type="noteref"

    them, and they became very frightened; so the sons of Israel cried out to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then they said to Moses, &ldquo;Is it because there
    were no

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses, &ldquo;Why are you crying out to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to go
    forward.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>As for you, lift up your staff and reach out with your

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then the
    angel of God, who had been going before the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud
    moved from before them and stood behind them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of

    Therefore the one did not approach the other all night.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then Moses

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So the sons of Israel <small class="small1"><sup

    said, &ldquo;Let me flee from Israel, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is fighting for them against the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses, &ldquo;Reach out with your hand over the sea so that the waters may

    back over the Egyptians, over their chariots and their horsemen.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So Moses reached out with his hand over the sea, and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>The waters returned and covered the chariots and the
