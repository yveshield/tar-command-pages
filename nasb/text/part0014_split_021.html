    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now when Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled the
    house of Judah and Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    came to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

    So they
    listened to
    the words of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and returned from going against Jeroboam.
