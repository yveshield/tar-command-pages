  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel Demands a King</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about, when Samuel was old, that he appointed his
    sons as judges over Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>The name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his
    second, Abijah; <i class="calibre12">they were</i> judging in Beersheba.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>His sons, however, did not walk in his ways but turned
    aside after dishonest gain, and they took bribes and perverted justice.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Then all the
    elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>and they said to him, &ldquo;Behold, you have grown old,
    and
    your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint us a king to judge us like all the nations.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But the matter was <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1293-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1293-1">a</a></sup></small>displeasing in the sight of Samuel when they said,
    &ldquo;Give us a king to judge us.&rdquo; And Samuel prayed to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Samuel,
    &ldquo;Listen to the voice of the people regarding all that they say to you, because they have not rejected you, but
    they
    have rejected Me from being King over them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Like all the deeds which they have done since the day
    that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have abandoned Me and served other gods—so they are
    doing to you as well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now then, listen to their voice; however, you shall warn
    them strongly and tell them of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1293-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1293-2">b</a></sup></small>practice of the king who will
    reign over them.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Warning concerning a King</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So Samuel spoke all the words of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> to the people who had asked him for a king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;This will be the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1294-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1294-1">c</a></sup></small>practice of the king who will reign over you: he
    will take your sons and put <i class="calibre12">them</i> in his chariots for himself and among his horsemen, and
    they will run before his chariots.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>He will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and
    commanders of fifties, and <i class="calibre12">some</i> to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1294-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1294-2">d</a></sup></small>do his plowing
    and to gather in his harvest, and to make his weapons of war and equipment for his chariots.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>He will also take your daughters <i
      class="calibre12">and use them</i> as perfumers, cooks, and bakers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards,
    and your olive groves, and give <i class="calibre12">them</i> to his servants.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And he will take a tenth of your seed and your
    vineyards and give <i class="calibre12">it</i> to his high officials and his servants.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>He will also take your male servants and your female
    servants, and your best young men, and your donkeys, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1294-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1294-3">e</a></sup></small>use <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> for his work.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves
    will become his servants.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then you will cry out on that day because of your king
    whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will not answer you on that
    day.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Yet the
    people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, &ldquo;No, but there shall be a king over us,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>so that we also may be like all the nations, and our
    king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Now after Samuel had heard all the words of the people,
    he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1295-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1295-1">f</a></sup></small>repeated them in the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> hearing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
    Samuel, &ldquo;Listen to their voice and appoint a king for them.&rdquo; So Samuel said to the men of Israel,
    &ldquo;Go,
    every man to
    his city.&rdquo;
