  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
    reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He did what was right in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, only not wholeheartedly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2069-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2069-1">a</a></sup></small>firmly in his grasp, that he killed his servants who
    had killed his father the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>However, he did not put their children to death, but <i
      class="calibre12">did</i> as it is written in the Law in the Book of Moses, which the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> commanded, saying, &ldquo;Fathers shall not be put to death for sons, nor sons be put to
    death
    for fathers; but each shall be put to death for his own sin.&rdquo;

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Moreover, Amaziah assembled Judah and appointed them according

    twenty years old and upward and found them to be three hundred thousand choice men, <i class="calibre12">able</i> to
    go to war <i class="calibre12">and</i> handle spear and shield.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He also hired a hundred thousand valiant warriors from
    Israel for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2070-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>But a man of God came to him saying, &ldquo;O king, do
    not let

      class="calibre12">nor with</i> any of the sons of Ephraim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But if you do go, do <i class="calibre12">it,</i> be
    strong for the battle; <i class="calibre12">yet</i> God will <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    down.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Amaziah said to the man of God, &ldquo;But what <i
      class="calibre12">are we</i> to do about the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2070-5"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Amaziah <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2070-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2070-6">g</a></sup></small>dismissed the troops which came to him from Ephraim,
    to go home; so their anger burned against Judah, and they returned <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    anger.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now Amaziah
    gathered his courage and led his people out, and went to the Valley of Salt, and struck and killed ten thousand of
    the sons of Seir.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>The sons of Judah also captured ten thousand alive and
    brought them to the top of the cliff, and threw them down from the top of the cliff so that they were all dashed to
    pieces.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2071-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2071-1">i</a></sup></small>troops whom
    Amaziah sent back, <i class="calibre12">those</i> not going with him to battle, raided the cities of Judah from
    Samaria to Beth-horon, and struck and killed three thousand of them, and plundered a large amount of spoils.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Amaziah Rebuked for Idolatry</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Now after Amaziah came from slaughtering the Edomites, he
    brought the gods of the sons of Seir and set them up as his gods. Then he bowed down before them and burned incense
    to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So the anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    burned against Amaziah, and He sent him a prophet who said to him, &ldquo;Why have you sought the gods of the people
    who
    have not saved their own people from your hand?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>As he was talking with him, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2072-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2072-1">j</a></sup></small>the king said to him, &ldquo;Have we appointed you
    to be a
    royal counselor? Stop! Why should <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2072-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2072-2">k</a></sup></small>you be put to death?&rdquo; Then
    the
    prophet stopped and said, &ldquo;I know that God has planned to destroy you, because you have done this and have not
    listened to my counsel.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Amaziah Defeated by Joash of Israel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Then Amaziah king of Judah took counsel and sent <i
      class="calibre12">word</i> to Joash the son of Jehoahaz the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, &ldquo;Come,
    let&rsquo;s
    face each other.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But Joash the king of Israel sent <i
      class="calibre12">a reply</i> to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The thorn bush that was in Lebanon sent <i
      class="calibre12">word</i> to the cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, &lsquo;Give your daughter to my son in
    marriage.&rsquo;
    But a wild beast that was in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>You said, &lsquo;Behold, you have <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2073-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2073-1">l</a></sup></small>defeated Edom.&rsquo; And your heart has lifted you
    up in
    boasting. Now stay home; why should you provoke trouble so that you, would fall, you and Judah with you?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> But Amaziah
    would not listen, for it was from God, so that He might hand them over <i class="calibre12">to Joash,</i> because
    they had sought the gods of Edom.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So Joash king of Israel went up, and he and Amaziah
    king of Judah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which belonged to Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And Judah was defeated <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Then Joash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of
    Judah, the son of Joash the son of Jehoahaz, at Beth-shemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of
    Jerusalem from the Gate of Ephraim to the Corner Gate, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    cubits.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small><i class="calibre12">He took</i> all the gold and
    silver and all the utensils which were found in the house of God with Obed-edom, and the treasures of the
    king&rsquo;s
    house, the hostages too, and returned to Samaria.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> And Amaziah,
    the son of Joash king of Judah, lived fifteen years after the death of Joash, son of Jehoahaz, king of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, from the first to
    the last, behold, are they not written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>From the time that Amaziah turned away from following
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> they conspired against him in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish; but they sent
    <i class="calibre12">men</i> after him to Lachish, and they killed him there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Then they brought him on horses and buried him with his
    fathers in the city of Judah.
