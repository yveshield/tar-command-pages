    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to
    them,
    and bring them into the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, into one of the chambers, and give them wine
    to drink.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, son of
    Habazziniah, and his brothers and all his sons, and all the household of the Rechabites,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>and I brought them into the house of the L<span

    next to the chamber of the officials, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the doorkeeper.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then I set before the <small class="small1"><sup

    wine, and cups; and I said to them, &ldquo;Drink wine!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But they said, &ldquo;We will not drink wine, for
    Jonadab the
    son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying, &lsquo;You shall not drink wine, you or your sons, forever.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>You shall not build a house, and you shall not sow seed
    nor plant a vineyard, nor <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4993-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And we have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of
    Rechab, our father, in all that he commanded us, not to drink wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, or our
    daughters,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>nor to build ourselves houses to live in; and we do not
    have a vineyard, a field, or seed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But we have lived <i class="calibre12">only</i> in
    tents, and have obeyed and have done according to all that our father Jonadab commanded us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>However, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up
    against the land, we said, &lsquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s go to Jerusalem away from the army of the Chaldeans and the
    army
    of the
    Arameans.&rsquo; So we have lived in Jerusalem.&rdquo;

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to

    this day, for they have obeyed their father&rsquo;s command. But I have spoken to you again and again, yet you have
    not
    listened to Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Also I have sent to you all My servants the prophets,
