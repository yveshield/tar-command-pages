            Moses used
            to take the tent and pitch it outside the camp, a good distance from the camp, and he called it the tent of
            meeting.
            And everyone who sought the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> would go out to the tent of meeting which was
            outside
            the camp.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And it came about, whenever Moses went out to
            the tent,
            that all the people would arise and stand, each at the entrance of his tent, and gaze after Moses until he
            entered
            the tent.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>When all the people saw the pillar of cloud
            standing at
            the entrance of the tent, all the people would stand and worship, each at the entrance of his tent.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> used to
            speak
            to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When <small class="small1"><sup
