    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around Him
    and listening to the word of God, He was standing by the lake of Gennesaret;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and He saw two boats lying at the edge of the lake; but
    the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And He got into one of the boats, which was
    Simon&rsquo;s, and
    asked him to put out a little <i class="calibre12">distance</i> from the land. And He sat down and <i
      class="calibre12">continued</i> teaching the crowds from the boat.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now when He had finished speaking, He said to Simon,
    &ldquo;Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Simon responded and said, &ldquo;Master, we worked hard
    all
    night and caught nothing, but <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6357-1" epub:type="noteref"

    let down the nets.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And when they had done this, they caught a great
    quantity of fish, and their nets <i class="calibre12">began</i> to tear;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>so they signaled to their partners in the other boat to
    come and help them. And they came and filled both of the boats, to the point that they were sinking.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But when Simon Peter saw <i class="calibre12">this,</i>
    he fell down at Jesus&rsquo; knees, saying, &ldquo;Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For amazement had seized him and all his companions
    because of the catch of fish which they had taken;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>and likewise also <i class="calibre12">were</i> <small

    with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, &ldquo;Do not fear; from now on you will be catching people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>When they had brought their boats to land, they left
    everything and followed Him.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And He reached out with His hand and touched him,
