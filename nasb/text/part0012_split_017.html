            found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds; and he came and sliced them into the pot
            of
            stew, because they did not know <i class="calibre12">what they were.</i>
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>So they poured <i class="calibre12">it</i> out
            for the
            men to eat. But as they were eating the stew, they cried out and said, &ldquo;You man of God, there is death
            in the
            pot!&rdquo;
            And they were unable to eat.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;Bring flour.&rdquo; And he
            threw it into
            the
            pot, and said, &ldquo;Pour <i class="calibre12">it</i> out for the people that they may eat.&rdquo; Then
            there was nothing
            harmful in the pot.

            came from Baal-shalishah, and brought the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley and
            fresh
            grain in his sack. And <i class="calibre12">Elisha</i> said, &ldquo;Give <i class="calibre12">them</i> to
