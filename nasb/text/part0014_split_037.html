  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jotham Succeeds Uzziah in Judah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
    reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Jerushah the daughter of Zadok.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He did what was right in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, according to all that his father Uzziah had done; however he did not enter the temple
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. But the people continued acting corruptly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>He built the upper gate of the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and he built the wall of Ophel extensively.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Moreover, he built cities in the hill country of Judah,
    and he built fortresses and towers on the wooded <i class="calibre12">hills.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>He fought with the king of the Ammonites and prevailed
    over them so that during that year the Ammonites gave him <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    talents of silver, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2079-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2079-2">b</a></sup></small>ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand of
    barley. The Ammonites also paid him this <i class="calibre12">amount</i> in the second year and in the third.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Jotham became powerful because he directed his ways
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> his God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, all his wars and his
    ways, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
    reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And Jotham <small class="small1"><sup

    the city of David; and his son Ahaz became king in his place.
