  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jeremiah Warns against Trust in Pharaoh</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Zedekiah the son of Josiah whom Nebuchadnezzar king of
    Babylon had made king in the land of Judah, reigned as king in place of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But neither he nor his servants nor the people of the
    land listened to the words of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which He spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Yet King
    Zedekiah sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah, and the priest Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, to Jeremiah the prophet,
    saying, &ldquo;Please pray to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God in our behalf.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now Jeremiah was <i class="calibre12">still</i> coming
    and going among the people, for they had not <i class="calibre12">yet</i> put him in prison.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Meanwhile, Pharaoh&rsquo;s army had set out from Egypt;
    and
    when the Chaldeans who had been besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the
    God of Israel says: &lsquo;This is what you are to say to the king of Judah, who sent you to Me to inquire of Me:
    &ldquo;Behold,
    Pharaoh&rsquo;s army, which has come out to help you, is going to return to its own land of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then the Chaldeans will return and fight against this
    city, and they will capture it and burn it with fire.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says:
    &lsquo;Do not deceive yourselves, saying, &ldquo;The Chaldeans will certainly go <i class="calibre12">away</i> from
    us,&rdquo;
    for
    they will not go.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>For even if you had defeated the entire army of
    Chaldeans who were fighting against you, and there were <i class="calibre12">only</i> wounded men left among them,
    each man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jeremiah Imprisoned</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now it happened when the army of the Chaldeans had withdrawn
    from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh&rsquo;s army,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>that Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the land of
    Benjamin in order to take <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5000-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f5000-1">a</a></sup></small>possession of <i class="calibre12">some</i> property
    there among the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>While he was at the Gate of Benjamin, a captain of the
    guard whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah the son of Hananiah was there; and he arrested Jeremiah the
    prophet, saying, &ldquo;You are deserting to the Chaldeans!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But Jeremiah said, &ldquo;A lie! I am not deserting to
    the
    Chaldeans&rdquo;; yet he would not listen to him. So Irijah arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then the officials were angry at Jeremiah and they beat
    him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe, for they had made it into the prison.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>For Jeremiah had come into the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5000-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f5000-2">b</a></sup></small>dungeon, that is, the vaulted cell; and Jeremiah
    stayed there many days.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Now King
    Zedekiah sent <i class="calibre12">men</i> and took him <i class="calibre12">out;</i> and in his palace the king
    secretly asked him and said, &ldquo;Is there a word from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>?&rdquo; And Jeremiah
    said,
    &ldquo;There
    is!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;You will be handed over to the king of Babylon!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Moreover, Jeremiah said to King Zedekiah, &ldquo;<i
      class="calibre12">In</i> what <i class="calibre12">way</i> have I sinned against you, or your servants, or this
    people, that you have put me in prison?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And where are your prophets who prophesied to you,
    saying, &lsquo;The king of Babylon will not come against you or against this land&rsquo;?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But now, please listen, my lord the king; please let my
    plea <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5001-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f5001-1">c</a></sup></small>come before you and do not make me return to the
    house of Jonathan the scribe, so that I will not die there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then King Zedekiah gave a command, and they placed
    Jeremiah in custody in the courtyard of the guardhouse, and gave him a loaf of bread daily from the bakers&rsquo;
    street,
    until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
