  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now <i class="calibre12">Paul</i> also came to Derbe and to
    Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a
    Greek,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and he was well spoken of by the brothers <i
      class="calibre12">and sisters</i> who were in Lystra and Iconium.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Paul wanted this man to leave with him; and he took him
    and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now while they were passing through the cities, they
    were delivering the ordinances for them to follow which had been determined by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So the churches were being strengthened <small

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> They passed
    through the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6727-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6727-1">b</a></sup></small>Phrygian and Galatian region, after being forbidden
    by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6727-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6727-2">c</a></sup></small>Asia;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>and after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go
    into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>and passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of
    Macedonia was standing and pleading with him, and saying, &ldquo;Come over to Macedonia and help us.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>When he had seen the vision, we immediately sought to
    leave for Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> So after
    setting sail from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the following <i class="calibre12">day</i>
    to Neapolis;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of
    the district of Macedonia, a <i class="calibre12">Roman</i> colony; and we were spending some days in this city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a
    riverside, where we were thinking that there was a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women
    who had assembled.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">First Convert in Europe</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>A woman named Lydia was listening; <i
      class="calibre12">she was</i> a seller of purple fabrics from the city of Thyatira, <i class="calibre12">and</i> a
    worshiper of God. <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6728-1" epub:type="noteref"

    spoken by Paul.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Now when she and her household had been baptized, she
    urged <i class="calibre12">us,</i> saying, &ldquo;If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my
    house and
    stay.&rdquo; And she prevailed upon us.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> It happened
    that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave woman who had a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing
    great profit to her masters by fortune-telling.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>She followed Paul and us and cried out <i
      class="calibre12">repeatedly,</i> saying, &ldquo;These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are
    proclaiming
    to you a way of salvation.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now she continued doing this for many days. But Paul
    was greatly annoyed, and he turned and said to the spirit, &ldquo;I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come
    out of
    her!&rdquo; And it came out at that very <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6729-1"

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> But when her
    masters saw that their hope of profit was <i class="calibre12">suddenly</i> gone, they seized Paul and Silas and
    dragged them into the marketplace before the authorities,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>and when they had brought them to the chief
    magistrates, they said, &ldquo;These men, Jews as they are, are causing our city trouble,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>and they are proclaiming customs that are not lawful
    for us to accept or to practice, <i class="calibre12">since</i> we are Romans.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Paul and Silas Imprisoned</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>The crowd joined in an attack against them, and the

          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6730-1">f</a></sup></small>robes off them and proceeded to order <small

          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6730-2">g</a></sup></small><i class="calibre12">them</i> to be beaten with
    rods.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>When they had struck them with many blows, they threw
    them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6730-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6730-3">h</a></sup></small>and he, having
    received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6730-4">i</a></sup></small>stocks.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Now about
    midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the
    foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone&rsquo;s chains were
    unfastened.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>When the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened,
    he drew <i class="calibre12">his</i> sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying,
    &ldquo;Do not
    harm yourself, for we are all here!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">the jailer</i> asked for
    lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear, he fell down before Paul and Silas;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>and after he brought them out, he said, &ldquo;Sirs,
    what
    must I do to be saved?&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Jailer Converted</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>They said, &ldquo;Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you
    will be
    saved, you and your household.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>And they spoke the word of God to him together with all
    who were in his house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>And he took them that <i class="calibre12">very</i>
    hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>And he brought them into his house and set <small

    together with his whole household.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">35</b></span> Now when day
    came, the chief magistrates sent their officers, saying, &ldquo;Release those men.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>And the jailer reported these words to Paul, <i
      class="calibre12">saying,</i> &ldquo;The chief magistrates have sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> that you be
    released.
    So come out now and go in peace.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>But Paul said to them, &ldquo;After beating us in
    public
    without due process—men <i class="calibre12">who</i> are Romans—they threw us into prison; and now they are

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>The officers reported these words to the chief
    magistrates. And they became fearful when they heard that they were Romans,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>and they came and pleaded with them, and when they had
    led them out, they <i class="calibre12">repeatedly</i> asked them to leave the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>They left the prison and entered <i
