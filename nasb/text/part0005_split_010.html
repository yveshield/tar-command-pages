  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Sin of Nadab and Abihu</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective
    firepans, and after putting fire in them, placed incense on <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source530-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f530-1">a</a></sup></small>the fire and
    offered <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source530-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f530-2">b</a></sup></small>strange fire before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, which He had not commanded them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And fire came out from the presence of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and consumed them, and they died before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Moses said to Aaron, &ldquo;It is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> spoke, saying,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&lsquo;By those who come near Me I <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source530-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f530-3">c</a></sup></small>will be treated as holy, </div>
  <div class="block">And before all the people I will be honored.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    So Aaron, therefore, kept silent.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Moses called
    also to Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Aaron&rsquo;s uncle Uzziel, and said to them, &ldquo;Come forward, carry
    your
    relatives away from the front of the sanctuary to <i class="calibre12">an area</i> outside of the camp.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So they came forward and carried them, <i
      class="calibre12">still</i> in their tunics, to <i class="calibre12">an area</i> outside the camp, just as Moses
    had said.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons Eleazar and
    Ithamar, &ldquo;Do not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source531-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f531-1">d</a></sup></small>uncover your heads nor tear your clothes, so that you
    do not die and He does not become wrathful against all the congregation. But your <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source531-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f531-2">e</a></sup></small>kinsmen, the entire house of Israel, shall weep for
    the burning which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source531-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f531-3">f</a></sup></small>brought about.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>You shall not even go out from the doorway of the tent
    of meeting, or you will die; for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointing
    oil is
    upon you.&rdquo; So they did according to the word of Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> then spoke to Aaron, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>&ldquo;Do not drink wine or strong drink, neither you
    nor your
    sons with you, when you come into the tent of meeting, so that you do not die—it is a permanent statute throughout
    your generations—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>and to make a distinction between the holy and the
    profane, and between the unclean and the clean,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>and so as to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes
    which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has spoken to them through Moses.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Moses
    spoke to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, &ldquo;Take the grain offering that is left over
    from the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> offerings by fire and eat it as unleavened
    bread
    beside the altar, for it is most holy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your
    allotted portion and your sons&rsquo; allotted portion from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span> offerings by fire; for so I have been commanded.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>The breast of the wave offering, however, and the thigh
    of the offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you; for they have been
    given as your allotted portion and your sons&rsquo; allotted portion from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of
    the
    sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>They shall bring the thigh offered by lifting up and
    the breast offered by waving, along with the offerings by fire of the portions of fat, to present as a wave offering
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; so it shall be a thing perpetually due you and your sons with you, just
    as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> But Moses
    searched carefully for the goat of the sin offering, and behold, it had been burned! So he was angry with
    Aaron&rsquo;s
    surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>&ldquo;Why did you not eat the sin offering at the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source532-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f532-1">g</a></sup></small>holy place? For it is most holy, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source532-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f532-2">h</a></sup></small>He gave it to you to take away the guilt of the
    congregation, to make atonement for them before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Behold, since its blood had not been brought inside,
    into the sanctuary, you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I commanded!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But Aaron said to Moses, &ldquo;Behold, this <i
      class="calibre12">very</i> day they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>. When things like these happened to me, if I had eaten a sin offering today, would it
    have been good in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>When Moses heard <i class="calibre12">that,</i> it was
    good in his sight.
