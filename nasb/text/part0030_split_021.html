  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Parable of the Sower and Soils</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Again He began to teach by the sea. And such a very large
    crowd gathered to Him that He got into a boat on the sea and sat down; and the whole crowd was by the sea on the
    land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And He was teaching them many things in parables, and
    was saying to them in His teaching,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>&ldquo;Listen <i class="calibre12">to this!</i> Behold,
    the
    sower went out to sow;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>as he was sowing, some <i class="calibre12">seed</i>
    fell beside the road, and the birds came and ate it up.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Other <i class="calibre12">seed</i> fell on the rocky <i
      class="calibre12">ground</i> where it did not have much soil; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth
    of soil.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And when the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because
    it had no root, it withered away.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Other <i class="calibre12">seed</i> fell among the
    thorns, and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Other <i class="calibre12">seeds</i> fell into the good
    soil, and as they grew up and increased, they yielded a crop and produced thirty, sixty, and a hundred <i
      class="calibre12">times as much.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And He was saying, &ldquo;He who has ears to hear,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6222-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0031_split_009.html#f6222-1">a</a></sup></small>let him hear.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> As soon as He
    was alone, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6223-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0031_split_009.html#f6223-1">b</a></sup></small>His followers, along with the twelve <i
      class="calibre12">disciples, began</i> asking Him <i class="calibre12">about</i> the parables.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And He was saying to them, &ldquo;To you has been given
    the
    mystery of the kingdom of God, but for those who are outside, everything comes in parables,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>so that <span class="small1">WHILE SEEING THEY MAY
      SEE</span>, <span class="small1">AND NOT PERCEIVE</span>, <span class="small1">AND WHILE HEARING</span>, <span
      class="small1">THEY MAY HEAR</span>, <span class="small1">AND NOT UNDERSTAND</span>, <span
      class="small1">OTHERWISE THEY MIGHT RETURN AND IT WOULD BE FORGIVEN THEM</span>.&rdquo;

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> And He *said to them, &ldquo;Do you not understand this

    How will you understand all the parables?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>The sower sows the word.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>These are the ones who are beside the road where the
    word is sown; and when they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which has been sown in them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And in a similar way these are the ones sown <i
      class="calibre12">with seed</i> on the rocky <i class="calibre12">places,</i> who, when they hear the word,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> they have no <i

    affliction or persecution occurs because of the word, immediately they <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And others are the ones sown <i class="calibre12">with

    desires for other things enter and choke the word, and it <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    unfruitful.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And those are the ones sown <i class="calibre12">with
      seed</i> on the good soil; and they hear the word and accept <i class="calibre12">it</i> and bear fruit, thirty,
    sixty, and a hundred <i class="calibre12">times as much.</i>&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> And He was
    saying to them, &ldquo;A lamp is not brought to be put under a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    under a bed, is it? Is it not <i class="calibre12">brought</i> to be put on the lampstand?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has
    <i class="calibre12">anything</i> been secret, but that it would come to light.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>If anyone has ears to hear, <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And He was saying to them, &ldquo;Take care what you

    will be given; and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Parable of the Seed</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> And He was saying, &ldquo;The kingdom of God is like a man
    who
    casts seed upon the soil;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>and he goes to bed at night and gets up daily, and the
    seed sprouts and growsâ€”how, he himself does not know.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>The soil produces crops by itself; first the stalk,
    then the head, then the mature grain in the head.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Now when the crop permits, he immediately <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6226-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0031_split_009.html#f6226-1">i</a></sup></small>puts in the sickle, because the harvest has

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Parable of the Mustard Seed</i></p>

          href="part0031_split_009.html#f6227-1">j</a></sup></small>picture the kingdom of God, or by what parable shall
    we present it?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small><i class="calibre12">It is</i> like a mustard seed,
    which, when sown upon the soil, though it is the smallest of all the seeds that are upon the soil,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger
    than all the garden plants, and forms large branches, with the result that <span class="small1">THE BIRDS OF THE
      SKY</span> can <span class="small1">NEST UNDER</span> its shade.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">33</b></span> And with many
    such parables He was speaking the word to them, so far as they were able to <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>and He did not speak to them without a parable; but He
    was explaining everything privately to His own disciples.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus Stills the Sea</i></p>

    over to the other side.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>After dismissing the crowd, they *took Him along with
    them in the boat, just as He was; and other boats were with Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>And a fierce gale of wind *developed, and the waves
    were breaking over the boat so much that the boat was already filling <i class="calibre12">with water.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">yet Jesus</i> Himself was in

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>And He got up and rebuked the wind and said to the sea,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>They became very much afraid and said to one another,
    &ldquo;Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him?&rdquo;
