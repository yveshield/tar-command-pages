    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,
    king of Judah, this word came from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    says:
    &lsquo;Stand in the courtyard of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> house, and
    speak
    to
    all the cities of Judah who have come to worship <i class="calibre12">in</i> the L<span

    speak to
    them. Do not omit a word!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Perhaps they will listen and everyone will turn from his
    evil way, and I will relent of the disaster which I am planning to inflict on them because of the evil of their
    deeds.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And you shall say to them, &lsquo;This is what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;If you do not listen to Me, to walk in My Law which I have set before
    you,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>to listen to the words of My servants the prophets, whom
    I have been sending to you again and again, but you have not listened;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make
    this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Jeremiah
    spoke to all the officials and to all the people, saying, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent me to

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But as for me, behold, I am in your hands; do with me
    as is good and right in your sight.

    will bring innocent blood on yourselves, and on this city and its inhabitants; for truly the L<span
