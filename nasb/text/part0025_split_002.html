            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And King Zedekiah said, &ldquo;Behold, he is in

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the
            Ethiopian,

            king&rsquo;s palace to <i class="calibre12">a place</i> beneath the storeroom, and took from there worn-out
            clothes and worn-out rags, and
            let them down by ropes into the cistern to Jeremiah.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to
            Jeremiah, &ldquo;Now
            put these worn-out clothes and rags under your armpits under the ropes&rdquo;; and Jeremiah did so.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So they pulled Jeremiah out with the ropes and
            lifted
            him out of the cistern, and Jeremiah stayed in the courtyard of the guardhouse.

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, &ldquo;I
