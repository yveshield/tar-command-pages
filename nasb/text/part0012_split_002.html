  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now King Solomon loved many foreign women along with the
    daughter of Pharaoh: Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, <i class="calibre12">and</i> Hittite women,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>from the nations of which the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had said to the sons of Israel, &ldquo;You shall not <small class="small1"><sup

    in
    love.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>He had seven hundred wives, <i class="calibre12">who
      were</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1625-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1625-3">c</a></sup></small>princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his
    wives turned his heart away.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For when Solomon was old, his wives turned his heart
    away <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1625-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1625-4">d</a></sup></small>to follow other gods; and his heart was not <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For Solomon became a follower of Ashtoreth the goddess
    of the Sidonians, and of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1625-7" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1625-6">f</a></sup></small>Milcom the abhorrent idol of the Ammonites.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and did not follow the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> fully, as his father David <i
      class="calibre12">had done.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh, the
    abhorrent idol of Moab, on the mountain that is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1625-8"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0012_split_013.html#f1625-7">g</a></sup></small>east of Jerusalem, and for
    Molech, the abhorrent idol of the sons of Ammon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He also did the same for all his foreign wives, who
    burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Now the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>and had commanded him regarding this thing, that he was
    not to follow other gods; but he did not comply with what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
    Solomon, &ldquo;Since <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1626-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1626-1">h</a></sup></small>you have done this, and you have not kept My

    it to your servant.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>However, I will not do it in your days, <i
      class="calibre12">only</i> for the sake of your father David; <i class="calibre12">but</i> I will tear it away
    from the hand of your son.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Yet I will not tear away all the kingdom, <i
      class="calibre12">but</i> I will give one tribe to your son for the sake of My servant David, and for the sake of
    Jerusalem, which I have chosen.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">God Raises Adversaries</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> raised up an
    adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite; he was of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1627-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0012_split_013.html#f1627-1">i</a></sup></small>royal line in
    Edom.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For it came about, when David was in Edom and Joab the
    commander of the army had gone up to bury those killed <i class="calibre12">in battle,</i> and had struck and killed
    every male in Edom
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>(for Joab and all Israel stayed there for six months,
    until he had eliminated every male in Edom),
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>that Hadad fled <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1627-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1627-2">j</a></sup></small>to Egypt, he and certain Edomites of his
    father&rsquo;s
    servants with him, while Hadad <i class="calibre12">was</i> a young boy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>They set out from Midian and came to Paran; and they
    took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him
    food and gave him land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so
    that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And the sister of Tahpenes gave birth to his son
    Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house; and Genubath was in Pharaoh&rsquo;s house among the sons of
    Pharaoh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1627-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1627-3">k</a></sup></small>lay down with his fathers and that Joab the
    commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, &ldquo;Let me go, so that I may go to my own country.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>However, Pharaoh said to him, &ldquo;But what have you
    lacked
    with me that you are here, requesting to go to your own country?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;Nothing;
    nevertheless you
    must
    let me go.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> God also
    raised up <i class="calibre12">another</i> adversary against him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his
    master Hadadezer, king of Zobah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And he gathered men to himself and became leader of a
    marauding band, after David killed those <i class="calibre12">of Zobah;</i> and they went to Damascus and stayed
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1628-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So he was an adversary to Israel all the days of
    Solomon, along with the harm that Hadad <i class="calibre12">inflicted;</i> and he felt disgust for Israel and
    reigned over Aram.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Then Jeroboam

    breach of the city of his father David.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And it came about at that time, when Jeroboam went out
    of Jerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now <small class="small1"><sup

    both of them were alone in the field.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Then Ahijah took hold of the new cloak which was on him
    and tore it into twelve pieces.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>And he said to Jeroboam, &ldquo;Take for yourself ten
    pieces;
    for this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel says: &lsquo;Behold, I am going to tear the

    servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel),
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>because they have abandoned Me, and have worshiped
    Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the sons of Ammon; and they
    have not walked in My ways, doing what is right in My sight and <i class="calibre12">keeping</i> My statutes and My

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of

    kept My commandments and My statutes;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>but I will take the kingdom from his son&rsquo;s hand
