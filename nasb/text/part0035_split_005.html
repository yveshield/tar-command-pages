    her hair is given to her as a covering.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>For, in the first place, when you come together <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6932-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6932-1">j</a></sup></small>as a church, I hear that <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Therefore when you come together it is not to eat the
    Lord&rsquo;s Supper,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>for when you eat, each one takes his own supper first;
    and one goes hungry while another gets drunk.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>What! Do you not have houses in which to eat and drink?
    Or do you despise the church of God and shame those who have nothing? What am I to say to you? Shall I praise you?
    In this I do not praise you.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Lord&rsquo;s Supper</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to
    you, that the Lord Jesus, on the night when He was betrayed, took bread;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>and when He had given thanks, He broke it and said,
    &ldquo;This is My body, which is for you; do this in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>In the same way <i class="calibre12">He</i> also <i
      class="calibre12">took</i> the cup after supper, saying, &ldquo;This cup is the new covenant in My blood; do this,
    as
    often as you drink <i class="calibre12">it,</i> in remembrance of Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
    you proclaim the Lord&rsquo;s death until He comes.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> Therefore
    whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy way, shall be guilty of the body and the blood
    of the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>But a person must examine himself, and in so doing he
    is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>For the one who eats and drinks, eats and drinks
    judgment to himself if he does not <i class="calibre12">properly</i> recognize the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6933-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>For this reason many among you are weak and sick, and a
    number <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6933-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6933-2">n</a></sup></small>are asleep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>But if we judged ourselves rightly, we would not be
    judged.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord
    so that we will not be condemned along with the world.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">33</b></span> So then, my
    brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> when you come together to eat, wait for one another.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>If anyone is hungry, have him eat at home, so that you
    do not come together for judgment. As to the remaining matters, I will give instructions when I come.
