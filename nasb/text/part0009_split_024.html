            ground, and
            said to him, &ldquo;Why have I found favor in your sight that you should take notice of me, since I am a
            foreigner?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Boaz replied to her, &ldquo;All that you have

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then she said, &ldquo;I have found favor in
            your sight, my

            at

            and she
            ate and
            was satisfied and had some left.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his
            servants,
            saying, &ldquo;Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not <small class="small1"><sup

            may glean, and
            do not rebuke her.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> So
            she
            gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an <small

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And she picked <i class="calibre12">it</i> up
            and went
            into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. She also took <i class="calibre12">some</i>
            out and
            gave <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1257-2" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Her mother-in-law then said to her,
            &ldquo;Where did you
            glean today and where did you work? May he who took notice of you be blessed.&rdquo; So she told her
            mother-in-law
            with
            whom she had worked, and said, &ldquo;The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, &ldquo;May
            he be blessed
            of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> who has not withdrawn His kindness from the living and from the
            dead.&rdquo; Again
            Naomi said to her, &ldquo;The man is our relative; he is one of our redeemers.&rdquo;

            &lsquo;You
            are to stay close
            to my servants until they have finished all my harvest.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law Ruth,
            &ldquo;It is
            good, my daughter, that you go out with his young women, so that <i class="calibre12">others</i> do not

            in another field.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So she stayed close by the young women of Boaz
            in order
            to glean until the end of the barley harvest and the wheat harvest. And she lived with her mother-in-law.
