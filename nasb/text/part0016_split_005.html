    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the king and Haman came to drink <i
      class="calibre12">wine</i> with Esther the queen.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the king said to Esther on the second day also
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2265-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2265-1">a</a></sup></small>as they drank their wine at the banquet, &ldquo;What
    is
    your request, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your wish? Up to half of the kingdom it shall be
    done.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Queen Esther replied, &ldquo;If I have found favor
    in
    your sight, O king, and if it pleases the king, let my life be given me as my request, and my people as my wish;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>for we have been sold, I and my people, to be destroyed,
    killed, and eliminated. Now if we had only been sold as slaves, men and women, I would have kept silent, because the
    distress would not be sufficient <i class="calibre12">reason</i> to burden the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then King Ahasuerus <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2265-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2265-2">b</a></sup></small>asked Queen Esther, &ldquo;Who is he, and where is
    he,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2265-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2265-3">c</a></sup></small>who would presume to do such <i class="calibre12">a
      thing?</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And Esther said, &ldquo;A foe and an enemy is this
    wicked
    Haman!&rdquo; Then Haman became terrified before the king and queen.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Haman Is Hanged</i></p>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The king then got up in his anger from <small

          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2266-1">d</a></sup></small>drinking wine <i class="calibre12">and went</i> into
    the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg for his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that harm had been determined
    against him by the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Now when the king returned from the palace garden into
    the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2266-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2266-2">e</a></sup></small>place where they had been drinking wine, Haman was
    falling on the couch where Esther was. Then the king said, &ldquo;Will he even assault the queen with me in the
    house?&rdquo; As
    the word went out of the king&rsquo;s mouth, they covered Haman&rsquo;s face.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs who <i
      class="calibre12">stood</i> before the king, said, &ldquo;Indeed, behold, the wooden <i

    standing at Haman&rsquo;s house <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2266-3"

    made for Mordecai who
    spoke good in behalf of the king!&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;Hang him on it.&rdquo;

      class="calibre12">gallows</i> which he had prepared for Mordecai, and the king&rsquo;s anger subsided.
