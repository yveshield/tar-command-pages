  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now there was a great outcry of the people and of their wives
    against their Jewish brothers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>For there were those who said, &ldquo;We, our sons, and
    our
    daughters are many; therefore let&rsquo;s get grain so that we may eat and live.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And there were <i class="calibre12">others</i> who said,
    &ldquo;We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses so that we might get grain because of the
    famine.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>There also were those who said, &ldquo;We have borrowed
    money
    for the king&rsquo;s tax <i class="calibre12">on</i> our fields and our vineyards.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And now our flesh is like the flesh of our brothers, our
    children like their children. Yet behold, we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our
    daughters are forced into bondage <i class="calibre12">already,</i> and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2185-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_030.html#f2185-1">a</a></sup></small>we are helpless because our fields and vineyards
    belong to others.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then I was
    very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So I thought it over and contended with the nobles and
    the leading people, and said to them, &ldquo;You are lending at interest, each to his brother!&rdquo; Therefore, I
    held a
    great
    assembly against them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And I said to them, &ldquo;We, according to our ability,
    have
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2186-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-1">b</a></sup></small>redeemed our Jewish brothers who were sold to the
    nations; now would you even sell your brothers that they may be sold to us?&rdquo; Then they were silent and could
    not
    find a word <i class="calibre12">to say.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So I said, &ldquo;The thing which you are doing is not
    good;
    should you not walk in the fear of our God because of the taunting of the nations, our enemies?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And likewise I, my brothers, and my servants are
    lending them money and grain. Please, let&rsquo;s <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2186-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-2">c</a></sup></small>do without this interest.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Please, give back to them this very day their fields,
    their vineyards, their olive groves, and their houses, as well as the hundredth <i class="calibre12">part</i> of the
    money and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are charging as interest from them.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then they said, &ldquo;We will give <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> back and will require nothing from them; we will do exactly as you say.&rdquo; So I
    called the
    priests and made them take an oath to act in accordance with this <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2186-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-3">d</a></sup></small>promise.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>I also shook out the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2186-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-4">e</a></sup></small>front of my garment and said, &ldquo;So may God
    shake out
    every person from his house and from his possessions who does not keep this <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2186-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-5">f</a></sup></small>promise; just so may he be shaken out and
    emptied.&rdquo;
    And all the assembly said, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; And they praised the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. Then the
    people
    acted in
    accordance with this <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2186-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_030.html#f2186-5">f</a></sup></small>promise.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Nehemiah&rsquo;s Example</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Furthermore, since the day that I was appointed to be their
    governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes, for twelve
    years, neither I nor my kinsmen have eaten the governor&rsquo;s food <i class="calibre12">allowance.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But the previous governors who were before me <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2187-1" epub:type="noteref"

    and wine besides forty shekels of silver; even their servants domineered the people. But I did not do so because of
    <i class="calibre12">my</i> fear of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>I also <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    to the work on this wall; we did not buy any land, and all my servants were gathered there for the work.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Moreover, <i class="calibre12">there were</i> at my
    table 150 Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations that were around us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now that which was prepared for each day was one ox <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> six choice sheep; also birds were prepared for me, and every ten days all <i
      class="calibre12">sorts of</i> wine <i class="calibre12">were provided</i> in abundance. Yet for <i
      class="calibre12">all</i> this I did not request the governor&rsquo;s food <i class="calibre12">allowance,</i>
    because
    the forced labor was heavy on this people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Remember me, my God, for good, <i class="calibre12">in
      return for</i> all that I have done for this people.
