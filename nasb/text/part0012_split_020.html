  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate;
    and they said to one another, &ldquo;Why are we sitting here until we die?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>If we say, &lsquo;We will enter the city,&rsquo; then
    the
    famine is
    in the city and we will die there; but if we sit here, we will also die. Now then come, and let&rsquo;s go over to
    the
    camp of the Arameans. If they spare us, we will live; and if they kill us, then we will die.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So they got up at twilight to go to the camp of the
    Arameans; when they came to the outskirts of the camp of the Arameans, behold, there was no one there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For the Lord had made the army of the Arameans hear a
    sound of chariots, a sound of horses, <i class="calibre12">that is,</i> the sound of a great army; and they said to
    one another, &ldquo;Behold, the king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians
    against
    us, to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1732-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So they got up and fled at twilight, and abandoned their
    tents, their horses, and their donkeysâ€”<i class="calibre12">indeed</i> the camp <i class="calibre12">itself,</i>
    just as it was; and they fled for their lives.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When these men with leprosy came to the outskirts of the
    camp, they entered one tent and ate and drank, and carried from there silver, gold, and clothes, and they went and
    hid <i class="calibre12">them;</i> then they returned and entered another tent, and carried <i
      class="calibre12">valuables</i> from there <i class="calibre12">also,</i> and went and hid <i

    inform the
    king&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city,
    and told them, saying, &ldquo;We came to the camp of the Arameans, and behold, there was no one there, nor a human
    voice;
    only the horses tied and the donkeys tied, and the tents just as they were.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And the gatekeepers called and announced <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> inside the king&rsquo;s house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then the king got up in the night and said to his
    servants, &ldquo;I will now tell you what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we are hungry; so they have
    left
    the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, &lsquo;When they come out of the city, we will capture them alive
    and
    get into the city.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>One of his servants responded and said, &ldquo;Please,
    have
    some <i class="calibre12">men</i> take five of the horses that remain, which are left <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1733-2" epub:type="noteref"

      be in any case</i> like all the multitude of Israel who are left in it; behold, they <i class="calibre12">will
      be</i> like all the multitude of Israel who have <i class="calibre12">already</i> perished, so let us send <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> and see.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Therefore they took two chariots with horses, and the
    king sent <i class="calibre12">them</i> after the army of the Arameans, saying, &ldquo;Go and see.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Promise Fulfilled</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>They went after them to the Jordan, and behold, all the
    way was full of clothes and equipment which the Arameans had thrown away when they fled in a hurry. Then the
    messengers returned and informed the king.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> So the people
    went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. Then a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    on him at the gate, and he died, just as the man of God had said, who spoke when the king came down to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So it happened just as the man of God had spoken to the
    king, saying, &ldquo;Two <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1734-4" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small><i class="calibre12">At that time</i> the royal officer
    had responded to the man of God and said, &ldquo;Now even if the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> were to make

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And this is what happened to him, for the people
    trampled on him at the gate and he died.
