    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But those present said, &ldquo;Are you insulting

    an angel, nor a spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And a great uproar occurred; and some of the scribes of
    the Pharisaic party stood up and <i class="calibre12">started</i> arguing heatedly, saying, &ldquo;We find nothing
