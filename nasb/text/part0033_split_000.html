    where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.

    anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped His feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the
    perfume.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now he said this, not because he cared about the poor,

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> The large
    crowd of the Jews then learned that He was there; and they came, not on account of Jesus only, but so that they
    might also see Lazarus, whom He raised from the dead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But the chief priests planned to put Lazarus to death
    also,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>because on account of him many of the Jews were going
    away and were believing in Jesus.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>they took the branches of the palm trees and went out

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Now He was saying this to indicate what kind of death

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>For this reason they could not believe, for Isaiah said

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>These things Isaiah said because he saw His glory, and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>Nevertheless many, even of the rulers, believed in Him,
    but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing <i class="calibre12">Him,</i> so that they would not be
