    before
    you, and inscribe a city on itâ€”Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then lay siege against it, build a siege wall, pile up
    an assault ramp, set up camps, and place battering rams against it all around.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then get yourself an iron plate and set it up as an iron
    wall between yourself and the city, and direct your face toward it so that it is under siege, and besiege it. This
    <i class="calibre12">will be</i> a sign to the house of Israel.

    you are
    to lie down on your left side and put the wrongdoing of the house of Israel on it; you shall bear their wrongdoing
    for the number of days that you lie on it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For I have assigned you a number of days corresponding
    to the years of their wrongdoing, 390 days; so you shall bear the wrongdoing of the house of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>When you have completed these <i

    bear the wrongdoing of the house of Judah; I have assigned it to you for forty days, a day for each year.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then you shall direct your face toward the siege of
    Jerusalem with your arm bared, and prophesy against it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Now behold, I will put ropes <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>You shall eat it as a barley cake, having baked <i

    tremble with one another and waste away in their guilt.
