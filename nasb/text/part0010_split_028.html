  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about after the death of Saul, when David had
    returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that David stayed two days in Ziklag.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And on the third day, behold, a man came from <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1410-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1410-1">a</a></sup></small>Saul&rsquo;s camp with his clothes torn and <small

    David, he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then David said to him, &ldquo;From where do you
    come?&rdquo;
    And he
    said to him, &ldquo;I have escaped from the camp of Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>David said to him, &ldquo;How did things go? Please tell
    me.&rdquo;
    And he said, &ldquo;The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and
    Saul
    and his son Jonathan are also dead.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then David said to the young man who told him,
    &ldquo;How do
    you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>The young man who told him said, &ldquo;By chance I
    happened
    to be on Mount Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the horsemen had
    overtaken him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When he looked behind himself, he saw me, and called to
    me. And I said, &lsquo;Here I am.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then he said to me, &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; And I
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1410-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1410-3">c</a></sup></small>answered him, &lsquo;I am an Amalekite.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And he said to me, &lsquo;Please stand next to me and
    finish
    me off, for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1410-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1410-4">d</a></sup></small>agony has seized me because my <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1410-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1410-5">e</a></sup></small>life still lingers in me.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So I stood next to him and finished him off, because I
    knew that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown which <i class="calibre12">was</i> on his head
    and the band which <i class="calibre12">was</i> on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then David
    took hold of his clothes and tore them, and <i class="calibre12">so</i> also <i class="calibre12">did</i> all the
    men who <i class="calibre12">were</i> with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for
    Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the people of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and the house of Israel,
    because they had fallen by the sword.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then David said to the young man who informed him,
    &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; And he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1411-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1411-1">f</a></sup></small>answered, &ldquo;I am the son of
    a stranger, an
    Amalekite.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And David said to him, &ldquo;How is it you were not
    afraid
    to reach out with your hand to destroy the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    anointed?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then David called one of the young men and said,
    &ldquo;Come
    forward, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1411-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1411-2">g</a></sup></small>put him to death.&rdquo; So he struck him and he
    died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And David said to him, &ldquo;<small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1411-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1411-3">h</a></sup></small>Your blood is on your head, because your <i
