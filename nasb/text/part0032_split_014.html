  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and
    the mother of Jesus was there;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and both Jesus and His disciples were invited to the
    wedding.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>When the wine ran out, the mother of Jesus *said to Him,
    &ldquo;They have no wine.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;<small

    tells
    you, do it.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now there were six stone waterpots standing there for
    the Jewish custom of purification, containing <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6525-2"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;Fill the waterpots with
    water.&rdquo; So
    they filled them up to the brim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And He *said to them, &ldquo;Draw <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now when the headwaiter tasted the water which had
    become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the headwaiter
    *called the groom,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>and *said to him, &ldquo;Every man serves the good wine

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>This beginning of <i class="calibre12">His</i> <small

    glory; and His disciples believed in Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> After this He
    went down to Capernaum, He and His mother, and <i class="calibre12">His</i> brothers and His disciples; and they
    stayed there a few days.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">First Passoverâ€”Cleansing the Temple</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> The Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to
    Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And within the temple <i class="calibre12">grounds</i>
    He found those who were selling oxen, sheep, and doves, and the money changers seated <i class="calibre12">at their
      tables.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And He made a whip of <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-1">e</a></sup></small>cords, and drove <i class="calibre12">them</i> all
    out of the temple <i class="calibre12">area,</i> with the sheep and the oxen; and He poured out the coins of the
    money changers and overturned their tables;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>and to those who were selling the doves He said,
    &ldquo;Take
    these things away from here; stop making My Father&rsquo;s house a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6526-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-2">f</a></sup></small>place of
    business!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>His disciples remembered that it was written:
    &ldquo;Z<span class="small1">EAL FOR</span> Y<span class="small1">OUR HOUSE WILL CONSUME ME</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>The Jews then said to Him, &ldquo;What sign do You show
    us
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6526-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-3">g</a></sup></small>as your authority for doing these things?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Destroy this <small

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-4">h</a></sup></small>temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>The Jews then said, &ldquo;It took forty-six years to
    build
    this <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6526-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-5">i</a></sup></small>temple, and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> You will
    raise it up in three days?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But He was speaking about the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6526-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6526-6">j</a></sup></small>temple of His body.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So when He was raised from the dead, His disciples
    remembered that He said this; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now when He
    was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name as they observed His signs which He
    was doing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>But Jesus, on His part, was not entrusting Himself to
    them, because He knew all people,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>and because He did not need anyone to testify about
    mankind, for He Himself knew what was in mankind.
