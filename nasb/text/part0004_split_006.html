            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> In the third month after the sons of Israel had gone
            out of
            the land of Egypt, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source357-1" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0005_split_000.html#f357-1">a</a></sup></small>on that very day they came into
            the wilderness of
            Sinai.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>When they set out from Rephidim, they came to
            the
            wilderness of Sinai and camped in the wilderness; and there Israel camped in front of the mountain.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And Moses went up to God, and the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> called to him from the mountain, saying, &ldquo;This is what you shall say
            to the house of
            Jacob and tell the sons of Israel:
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&lsquo;You yourselves have seen what I did to
            the
            Egyptians,
            and <i class="calibre12">how</i> I carried you on eagles&rsquo; wings, and brought you to Myself.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now then, if you will indeed obey My voice and
            keep My
            covenant, then you shall be My <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source357-2"

            possession among all the peoples, for all the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and
            a holy
            nation.&rsquo; These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> So
            Moses came
            and called the elders of the people, and set before them all these words which the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span>
            had commanded him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then all the people answered together and said,
            &ldquo;All
            that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has spoken we will do!&rdquo; And Moses brought back the words of
            the
            people to
            the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said
            to Moses,
            &ldquo;Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and
            may also trust
            in you forever.&rdquo; Then Moses told the words of the people to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> The
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span> also said to Moses, &ldquo;Go to the people and consecrate them today and
            tomorrow, and have
            them wash their garments;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>and have them ready for the third day, for on
            the third
            day the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But you shall set boundaries for the people all
            around,
            saying, &lsquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source358-1" epub:type="noteref"

            the mountain or touch
            the border of it; whoever touches the mountain shall certainly be put to death.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>No hand shall touch him, but he shall certainly
            be
            stoned or <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source358-2" epub:type="noteref"

            person, <i class="calibre12">the violator</i> shall not live.&rsquo; When the ram&rsquo;s horn sounds a long
            blast, they
            shall come up to
            the mountain.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So Moses went down from the mountain to the
            people and
            consecrated the people, and they washed their garments.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>He also said to the people, &ldquo;Be ready for
            the third
            day; do not go near a woman.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> So it
            came
            about on the third day, when it was morning, that there were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            lightning flashes and a thick cloud over the mountain and a very loud trumpet sound, so that all the people
            who <i class="calibre12">were</i> in the camp trembled.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And Moses brought the people out of the camp to
            meet
            God, and they stood at the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source359-2"

            all in
            smoke because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> descended upon it in fire; and its smoke ascended like
            the smoke
            of a furnace, and the entire mountain <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source360-1"

            violently.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and
            louder,
            Moses spoke, and God answered him with <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source360-2"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came
            down on
            Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> called Moses to the top of
            the
            mountain, and Moses went up.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke
            to

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And Moses said to the L<span
