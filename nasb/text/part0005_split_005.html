  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Law of Guilt Offerings</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> &lsquo;Now if a person sins after he hears a <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source501-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f501-1">a</a></sup></small>public order <i class="calibre12">to testify</i> when
    he is a witness, whether he has seen or <i class="calibre12">otherwise</i> known, if he does not tell <i
      class="calibre12">it,</i> then he will bear his punishment.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Or if a person touches any unclean thing, whether a
    carcass of an unclean animal, or the carcass of unclean cattle, or a carcass of unclean swarming things, though it
    is hidden from him and he is unclean, then he will be guilty.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever <i
      class="calibre12">sort</i> his uncleanness <i class="calibre12">may</i> be with which he becomes unclean, and it
    is hidden from him, and then he comes to know <i class="calibre12">it,</i> he will be guilty.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Or if a person swears thoughtlessly with his lips to do
    evil or to do good, in whatever <i class="calibre12">matter</i> people speak thoughtlessly with an oath, and it is
    hidden from him, and then he comes to know <i class="calibre12">it,</i> he will be guilty of one of these things.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So it shall be when he becomes guilty of one of these
    things, that he shall confess that in which he has sinned.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He shall also bring his guilt offering to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> for his sin which he has <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source501-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f501-2">b</a></sup></small>committed, a

    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> his guilt offering for that in which he has sinned, two turtledoves or two young
    doves, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He shall bring them to the priest, who shall first offer
    that which is for the sin offering, and shall pinch off its head at the front of its neck, but he shall not sever <i
      class="calibre12">it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin
    offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar: it is
    a sin offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The second he shall then prepare as a burnt offering
    according to the ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin which he has <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source502-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f502-2">e</a></sup></small>committed, and it will be forgiven him.

    young doves, then for his offering for that which he has sinned, he shall bring the tenth of an <small

          href="part0005_split_027.html#f503-2">g</a></sup></small>ephah of fine flour as a sin offering; he shall not
    put oil on it or place incense on it, for it is a sin offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
    take his handful of it as its memorial portion and offer <i class="calibre12">it</i> up in smoke on the altar,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source503-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f503-3">h</a></sup></small>with the offerings of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> by fire: it is a sin offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So the priest shall make atonement for him concerning
    his sin which he has <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source503-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f503-4">i</a></sup></small>committed from one of these, and it will be forgiven
    him; then <i class="calibre12">the rest</i> shall become the priest&rsquo;s, like the grain
    offering.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Moses, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>&ldquo;If a person acts unfaithfully and sins
    unintentionally
    against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> holy things, then he shall bring
    his
    guilt offering to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>: a ram without defect from the flock, according to your
    assessment in silver by shekels, in <i class="calibre12">terms of</i> the shekel of the sanctuary, as a guilt
    offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And he shall make restitution for that which he has
    sinned against the holy thing, and shall add to it a fifth part of it and give it to the priest. The priest shall
    then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and it will be forgiven him.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> &ldquo;Now if
    a
    person sins and does any of the things <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source504-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f504-1">j</a></sup></small>which the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded not to be done, though he was unaware, he is still guilty and shall bear
    his punishment.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>He is then to bring to the priest a ram without defect
    from the flock, according to your assessment, as a guilt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for him
    concerning his sin which he committed unintentionally and did not know <i class="calibre12">it,</i> and it will be
    forgiven him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
