            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> And it came about in the month Nisan, in the twentieth
            year of
            King Artaxerxes, that wine <i class="calibre12">was</i> before him, and I picked up the wine and gave it to
            the
            king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So the king said to me, &ldquo;Why is your face
            sad,
            though
            you are not ill? This is nothing but sadness of heart.&rdquo; Then I was very much afraid.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And I said to the king, &ldquo;May the king live
            forever. Why

            So I prayed to the

            heaven.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then I said to the king, &ldquo;If it pleases

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then the king said to me, with the queen sitting

            me, and I
            gave

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So I went out at night by the Valley Gate in
            the

            King&rsquo;s

            the wall. Then I entered the Valley Gate again and returned.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>However, the officials did not know where I had

            were doing
            the work.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Then
            I said

            burned by
            fire.
            Come, let&rsquo;s rebuild the wall of Jerusalem so that we will no longer be a disgrace.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And I told them how the hand of my God had been
            favorable to me and also about the king&rsquo;s words which he had spoken to me. Then they said,
            &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s arise and
