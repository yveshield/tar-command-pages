  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Census Brings Plague</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Satan stood up against Israel and incited David to count
    Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So David said to Joab and to the leaders of the people,
    &ldquo;Go, count Israel from Beersheba to Dan, and bring me <i class="calibre12">word</i> so that I may know their
    number.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But Joab said, &ldquo;May the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>
    add to His people a hundred times as many as they are! My lord the king, are they not all my lord&rsquo;s servants?
    Why
    does my lord seek this thing? Why should he be a cause of guilt to Israel?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Nevertheless, the king&rsquo;s word prevailed against
    Joab.
    Therefore, Joab departed and went throughout Israel, and came to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then Joab gave the number of the census of the people to
    David. Israel was 1,100,000 men in all who drew the sword; and Judah <i class="calibre12">was</i> 470,000 men who
    drew the sword.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But he did not <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1934-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1934-1">a</a></sup></small>count Levi and Benjamin among them, because the
    king&rsquo;s <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1934-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1934-2">b</a></sup></small>command was abhorrent to Joab.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1935-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1935-1">c</a></sup></small>God was displeased with this thing, so He struck
    Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>David said to God, &ldquo;I have sinned greatly, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1935-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1935-2">d</a></sup></small>by doing this thing. But now, please overlook Your
    servant&rsquo;s guilt, for I have behaved very foolishly.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Gad, David&rsquo;s seer, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>&ldquo;Go and speak to David, saying, &lsquo;This is
    what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;I extend to you three <i class="calibre12">choices;</i> choose for
    yourself
    one of them, which I will do to you.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So Gad came to David and said to him, &ldquo;This is
    what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Take for yourself
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>three years of famine, or three months to be swept away
    before your foes while the sword of your enemies overtakes <i class="calibre12">you,</i> or else three days of the
    sword of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>: a plague in the land, and the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> destroying throughout the territory of Israel.&rsquo; Now, therefore, consider what
    answer I
    shall bring back to Him who sent me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>David said to Gad, &ldquo;I am in great distress;
    please let
    me fall into the hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, for His mercies are very great. But do not let me
    fall into human hands.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> So the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1936-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1936-1">e</a></sup></small>sent a plague on Israel; seventy thousand men of
    Israel fell.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And God sent an angel to Jerusalem to destroy it; but
    as he was about to destroy <i class="calibre12">it,</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> saw and was sorry about
    the catastrophe, and said to the destroying angel, &ldquo;It is enough; now relax your hand.&rdquo; And the angel of
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was standing by the threshing floor of <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1936-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1936-2">f</a></sup></small>Ornan the
    Jebusite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then David raised his eyes and saw the angel of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> standing between earth and heaven, with his drawn sword in his hand stretched out
    over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, covered with sackcloth, fell on their faces.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And David said to God, &ldquo;Is it not I who <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1936-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1936-3">g</a></sup></small>commanded to count the people? Indeed, I am the one
    who has sinned and acted very wickedly, but these sheep, what have they done? L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, my
    God, just let Your hand be against me and my father&rsquo;s household, and not against Your people as a
    plague.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David&rsquo;s Altar</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1937-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1937-1">h</a></sup></small>commanded Gad to say to David, that David was to go
    up and build an altar to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So David went up at the word of Gad, which he spoke in
    the name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Now Ornan turned back and saw the angel, and his four
    sons <i class="calibre12">who were</i> with him hid themselves. And Ornan was threshing wheat.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>As David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
    went out from the threshing floor and prostrated himself to David with his face to the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then David said to Ornan, &ldquo;Give me the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1937-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1937-2">i</a></sup></small>site of <i class="calibre12">this</i> threshing
    floor, so that I may build on it an altar to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; you shall give it to me for the
    full price, so that the plague may be brought to a halt from the people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But Ornan said to David, &ldquo;Take <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> for yourself, and may my lord the king do what is good in his sight. See, I am giving the
    oxen for burnt offerings, and the threshing sledges for wood and the wheat for the grain offering; I am giving <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> all.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Nevertheless, King David said to Ornan, &ldquo;No, but
    I will
    certainly buy <i class="calibre12">it</i> for the full price; for I will not take what is yours for the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, nor offer a burnt offering <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1937-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0014_split_010.html#f1937-3">j</a></sup></small>which costs me
    nothing.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So David gave Ornan six hundred shekels of gold by
    weight for the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1937-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1937-4">k</a></sup></small>site.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then David built an altar there to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And he called to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and He answered him with fire from heaven on the altar of burnt offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> commanded the
    angel, and he returned his sword to its sheath.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> At that time,
    when David saw that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had answered him on the threshing floor of Ornan the
    Jebusite, he offered sacrifice there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>For the tabernacle of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, which Moses had made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt offering <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> on the high place at Gibeon at that time.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for
    he was terrified by the sword of the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
