  <p class="head">1 SAMUEL 11&nbsp;<a href="part0001_split_000.html#bob" class="calibre7"><span

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Saul Defeats the Ammonites</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Nahash the Ammonite went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead;
    and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, &ldquo;Make a covenant with us and we will serve you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But Nahash the Ammonite said to them, &ldquo;I will make
    <i class="calibre12">it</i> with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, and
    <i class="calibre12">thereby</i> I will inflict a disgrace on all Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So the elders of Jabesh said to him, &ldquo;Allow us
    seven
    days to send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out to
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and spoke <i
      class="calibre12">these</i> words in the hearing of the people, and all the people raised their voices and wept.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Now behold,
    Saul was coming from the field behind the oxen, and Saul said, &ldquo;What is <i class="calibre12">the matter</i>
    with the
    people that they weep?&rdquo; So they reported to him the words of the men of Jabesh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then the Spirit of God rushed upon Saul when he heard
    these words, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1307-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1307-1">a</a></sup></small>he became very angry.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>He then took a yoke of oxen and cut them in pieces, and
    sent <i class="calibre12">them</i> throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying,
    &ldquo;Whoever
    does not come out after Saul and after Samuel, the same shall be done to his oxen.&rdquo; Then the dread of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> fell on the people, and they came out as one person.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1307-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1307-2">b</a></sup></small>counted them
    in Bezek; and the sons of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah, thirty thousand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>They said to the messengers who had come, &ldquo;This is
    what
    you shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: &lsquo;Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be
    saved.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    So the
    messengers went and told the men of Jabesh; and they rejoiced.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then the men of Jabesh said, &ldquo;Tomorrow we will
    come out
    to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1307-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1307-3">c</a></sup></small>to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The next morning Saul put the people in three
    companies; and they came into the midst of the camp at the morning watch, and struck and killed the Ammonites until
    the heat of the day. And those who survived scattered, so that no two of them were left together.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the
    people said to Samuel, &ldquo;Who is he that said, &lsquo;Shall Saul reign over us?&rsquo; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1308-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1308-1">d</a></sup></small>Bring the men, so that we may put them to
    death!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But Saul said, &ldquo;Not a single person shall be put
    to
    death this day, for today the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has brought about <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1308-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1308-2">e</a></sup></small>victory in Israel.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then Samuel
    said to the people, &ldquo;Come, and let us go to Gilgal and renew the kingdom there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made
    Saul king before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in Gilgal. There they also offered sacrifices of peace
    offerings before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.
