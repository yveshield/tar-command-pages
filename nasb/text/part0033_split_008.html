  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Empty Tomb</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now on the first <i class="calibre12">day</i> of the week Mary
    Magdalene *came early to the tomb, while it was still dark, and *saw the stone <i class="calibre12">already</i>
    removed from the tomb.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So she *ran and *came to Simon Peter and to the other
    disciple whom Jesus loved, and *said to them, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know
    where they
    have put Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Peter and the other disciple left, and they were
    going to the tomb.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>The two were running together; and the other disciple
    ran ahead, faster than Peter, and came to the tomb first;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>and he stooped to look <i class="calibre12">in,</i> and
    *saw the linen wrappings lying <i class="calibre12">there;</i> however he did not go in.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Simon Peter also *came, following him, and he entered
    the tomb; and he *looked at the linen wrappings lying <i class="calibre12">there,</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>and the face-cloth which had been on His head, not lying
    with the linen wrappings but folded up in a place by itself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So the other disciple who had first come to the tomb
    also entered then, and he saw and believed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For they did not yet understand the Scripture, that He
    must rise from the dead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So the disciples went away again to their own <i
      class="calibre12">homes.</i>
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> But Mary was
    standing outside the tomb, weeping; so as she wept, she stooped to look into the tomb;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and she *saw two angels in white sitting, one at the
    head and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had been lying.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And they *said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you
    weeping?&rdquo;
    She *said to them, &ldquo;Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When she had said this, she turned around and *saw
    Jesus standing <i class="calibre12">there,</i> and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> she did not know that it was Jesus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping?
    Whom
    are you seeking?&rdquo; Thinking that He was the gardener, she *said to Him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried Him
    away,
    tell me
    where you put Him, and I will take Him away.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;Mary!&rdquo; She turned and
    *said
    to Him
    in <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6625-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6625-1">a</a></sup></small>Hebrew, &ldquo;Rabboni!&rdquo; (which means,
    Teacher).
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;Stop clinging to Me, for I
    have
    not yet ascended to the Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, &lsquo;I am ascending to My Father and your
    Father,
    and My God and your God.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Mary Magdalene *came and announced to the disciples,
    &ldquo;I
    have seen the Lord,&rdquo; and <i class="calibre12">that</i> He had said these things to her.

    came and stood in their midst, and *said to them, &ldquo;Peace <i class="calibre12">be</i> to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And when He had said this, He showed them both His
    hands and His side. The disciples then rejoiced when they saw the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace <i
      class="calibre12">be</i> to you; just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And when He had said this, He breathed on them and
