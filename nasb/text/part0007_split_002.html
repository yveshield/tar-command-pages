  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had a very large
    number of livestock. So when they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, that <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source798-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f798-1">a</a></sup></small>it was indeed a place suitable for livestock,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and spoke to
    Moses, Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>&ldquo;Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh,
    Sebam,
    Nebo, and Beon,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>the land which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source798-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f798-2">b</a></sup></small>conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a
    land for livestock, and your servants have livestock.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And they said, &ldquo;If we have found favor in your
    sight,
    let this land be given to your servants as <i class="calibre12">our</i> property; do not take us across the
    Jordan.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> But Moses said
    to the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, &ldquo;Should your brothers go to war while you remain here?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And why are you discouraging the <small

          href="part0007_split_006.html#f799-1">c</a></sup></small>sons of Israel from crossing over into the land which
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has given them?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>This is what your fathers did when I sent them from
    Kadesh-barnea to see the land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For when they went up to the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source799-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f799-2">d</a></sup></small>Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged
    the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source799-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f799-3">e</a></sup></small>sons of Israel so that they did not go into the land
    which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had given them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span> anger burned on that day, and He swore, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>&lsquo;None of the men who came up from Egypt, from
    twenty
    years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; for they did not follow
    Me fully,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and
    Joshua the son of Nun; for they have followed the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> fully.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span> anger burned against Israel, and He made them wander in the wilderness for forty years,
    until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to
    an end.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Now behold, you have risen up in your fathers&rsquo;
    place,
    born of sinful men, to add still more to the burning anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> against Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For <i class="calibre12">if</i> you turn away from
    following Him, He will once more leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then they
    approached him and said, &ldquo;We will build sheepfolds for our livestock here and cities for our little ones;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>but we ourselves will be armed, hurrying ahead of the
    sons of Israel, until we have brought them to their place, while our little ones live in the fortified cities
    because of the inhabitants of the land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>We will not return to our homes until every one of the
    sons of Israel has gained possession of his inheritance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But we will not have an inheritance with them on the
    other side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan toward the
    east.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> So Moses said
    to them, &ldquo;If you will do <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source800-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f800-1">f</a></sup></small>this, if you will arm yourselves before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> for the war,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>and all of you armed men cross over the Jordan before
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> until He has driven His enemies out from Him,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>and the land is subdued before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, then afterward you may return and be <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source800-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f800-2">g</a></sup></small>free of
    obligation toward the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and toward Israel, and this land shall be yours as property
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But if you do not do so, behold, you have sinned
    against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and be sure that your sin will find you out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Build yourselves cities for your little ones, and
    sheepfolds for your sheep, and do <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source800-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f800-3">h</a></sup></small>what you have promised.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Then the sons
    of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;Your servants will do just as my lord commands.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Our little ones, our wives, our livestock, and all our
    cattle shall <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source801-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f801-1">i</a></sup></small>remain there in the cities of Gilead,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>while your servants, <i class="calibre12">that is,</i>
    everyone who is armed for war, cross over in the presence of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to battle, just as
    my lord says.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> So Moses gave
    the command regarding them to Eleazar the priest, to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers&rsquo;
    <i class="calibre12">households</i> of the tribes of the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And Moses said to them, &ldquo;If the sons of Gad and
    the
    sons of Reuben, everyone who is armed for battle, cross with you over the Jordan in the presence of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead as <i
      class="calibre12">their</i> property;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>but if they do not cross over with you armed, they
    shall instead be settled among you in the land of Canaan.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered,
    saying, &ldquo;As the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has said to your servants, so we will do.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>We ourselves will cross over armed in the presence of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> into the land of Canaan, and the property of our inheritance <i
      class="calibre12">shall remain</i> with us across the Jordan.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">33</b></span> So Moses gave
    to them, to the sons of Gad, the sons of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Joseph&rsquo;s son Manasseh, the kingdom
    of
    Sihon, king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities with <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>And the sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran as fortified cities, and
    sheepfolds for sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>The sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Nebo, and Baal-meon—<i class="calibre12">their</i>
    names being changed—and Sibmah, and they gave <i class="calibre12">other</i> names to the cities which they built.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead
    and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>So Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and
