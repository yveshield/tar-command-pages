  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David King over All Israel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1435-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1435-1">a</a></sup></small>said, &ldquo;Behold, we are your bone and your
    flesh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Previously, when Saul was king over us, you were the one
    who led Israel <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1435-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1435-2">b</a></sup></small>out and in. And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to you, &lsquo;You will shepherd My people Israel, and you will be a leader over Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron,
    and King David made a covenant with them before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in Hebron; then they anointed
    David king over Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>David was thirty years old when he became king, <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> he reigned for forty years.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>At Hebron he reigned over Judah for seven years and six
    months, and in Jerusalem he reigned for thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now the king
    and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land; and they said to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1436-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1436-1">c</a></sup></small>David, &ldquo;You shall not come in here, but <i
      class="calibre12">even</i> those who are blind and those who limp will turn you away,&rdquo; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1436-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1436-2">d</a></sup></small>thinking, &ldquo;David cannot enter here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold of Zion,
    that is, the city of David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And David said on that day, &ldquo;Whoever strikes the
    Jebusites is to reach those who limp and those who are blind, who are hated by David&rsquo;s soul, through the water
    tunnel.&rdquo; For that reason they say, &ldquo;People who are blind and people who limp shall not come into the
    house.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So David lived in the stronghold, and called it the city
    of David. And David built all around from the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1436-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1436-3">e</a></sup></small>Millo and inward.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>David became greater and greater, for the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God of armies was with him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then Hiram
    king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters, and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1437-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1437-1">f</a></sup></small>stonemasons; and they built a house for David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And David realized that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had appointed him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for the sake
    of His people Israel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Meanwhile
    David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were
    born to David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Now these are the names of those who were born to him
    in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">War with the Philistines</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Now when the Philistines heard that they had anointed David
    king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek out David; and when David heard <i class="calibre12">about
      it,</i> he went down to the stronghold.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now the Philistines came and overran the Valley of
    Rephaim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So David inquired of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, saying, &ldquo;Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to
    me?&rdquo;
    And the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to David, &ldquo;Go up, for I will certainly hand the Philistines over to
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then David came to Baal-perazim and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1438-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1438-1">g</a></sup></small>defeated them there; and he said, &ldquo;The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has broken through my enemies before me like the breakthrough of waters.&rdquo;
    Therefore he
    named that place <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1438-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1438-2">h</a></sup></small>Baal-perazim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">the Philistines</i> abandoned
    their idols there, so David and his men carried them away.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Now the
    Philistines came up once again and overran the Valley of Rephaim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So David inquired of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, but He said, &ldquo;You shall not go <i class="calibre12">directly</i> up; circle
    around
    behind them and come at them in front of the baka-shrubs.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And it shall be, when you hear the sound of marching in
    the tops of the baka-shrubs, then you shall <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1439-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1439-1">i</a></sup></small>act promptly, for then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then David did so, just as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded him; he struck and killed the Philistines from <small class="small1"><sup
