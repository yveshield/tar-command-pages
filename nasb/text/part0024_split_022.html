  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Hananiah&rsquo;s False Prophecy</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now in the same year, in the beginning of the reign of
    Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the fifth month, Hananiah the prophet the son of Azzur, who was from
    Gibeon, spoke to me at the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in the sight of the priests and all the
    people, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    of
    armies, the God of Israel says: &lsquo;I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Within two years I am going to bring back to this place
    all the vessels of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> house, which
    Nebuchadnezzar
    king of Babylon took from this place and brought to Babylon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>I am also going to bring back to this place Jeconiah the
    son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon,&rsquo; declares the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, &lsquo;for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then Jeremiah
    the prophet spoke to the prophet Hananiah in the sight of the priests and in the sight of all the people who were
    standing at the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>and Jeremiah the prophet said, &ldquo;Amen! May the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> do so; may the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> fulfill your words which you have
    prophesied, to bring back the vessels of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    house
    and all the exiles, from Babylon to this place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Yet hear now this word which I am going to speak <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4951-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4951-1">a</a></sup></small>so that you and all the people can hear it!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>The prophets who were before me and before you from
    ancient times also prophesied against many lands and against great kingdoms regarding war, disaster, and plague.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small><i class="calibre12">As for</i> the prophet who
    prophesies of peace, when the word of the prophet comes to pass, then that prophet will be known <i
      class="calibre12">as</i> one whom the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has truly sent.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then Hananiah
    the prophet took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Hananiah spoke in the sight of all the people, saying,
    &ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Even so within two full years I will break the
    yoke
    of
    Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Then Jeremiah the prophet went
    his
    way.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to Jeremiah after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from the
    neck of Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>&ldquo;Go and speak to Hananiah, saying, &lsquo;This is
    what
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;You have broken the yokes of wood, but in their place you have made
    yokes of
    iron.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    of armies, the God of Israel says: &ldquo;I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all these nations, to serve
    Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him. And I have also given him the animals of the
    field.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah the prophet,
    &ldquo;Listen now, Hananiah: the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has not sent you, and you have made this people
    trust in
    a lie.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Therefore, this is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Behold, I am going to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source4952-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0025_split_016.html#f4952-1">b</a></sup></small>remove you
    from the face of the earth. This year you are going to die, because you spoke falsely against the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> So Hananiah
    the prophet died in the same year, in the seventh month.
