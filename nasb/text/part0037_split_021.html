    there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.

    seven trumpets were given to them.

    came and stood at the altar, holding a golden censer; and much incense was given to him, so that he might <small

    hand with the prayers of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7348-3" epub:type="noteref"

    hurled it to the earth; and there were peals of thunder and sounds, and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And the seven
    angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.

    sounded, and there was hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled to the earth; and a third of the earth was
    burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> The second
    angel sounded, and <i class="calibre12">something</i> like a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the
