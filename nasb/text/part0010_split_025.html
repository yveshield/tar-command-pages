  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Philistines Mistrust David</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to
    Aphek, while the Israelites were camping by the spring which is in Jezreel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the governors of the Philistines were proceeding on,
    <i class="calibre12">leading</i> hundreds and thousands, and David and his men were proceeding in the back with
    Achish.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the commanders of the Philistines said, &ldquo;What
    <i class="calibre12">are</i> these Hebrews <i class="calibre12">doing here?</i>&rdquo; And Achish said to the
    commanders
    of
    the Philistines, &ldquo;Is this not David, the servant of Saul the king of Israel, who has been with me these days,
    or <i class="calibre12">rather</i> these years, and I have found nothing at all <i class="calibre12">suspicious</i>
    in
    him since the day he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1401-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1401-1">a</a></sup></small>deserted <i class="calibre12">to me</i> to this
    day?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with
    him, and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, &ldquo;Make the man go back, so that he will return to his
    place
    where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may become an
    adversary to us. For how could this <i class="calibre12">man</i> find favor with his lord? <i
      class="calibre12">Would it</i> not <i class="calibre12">be</i> with the heads of <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1401-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1401-2">b</a></sup></small>these men?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Is this not David, of whom they sing in the dances,
    saying,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, </div>
  <div class="block">And David his ten thousands&rsquo;?&rdquo;
  </div>
  <p class="aleft"><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then Achish called David and said to him,
    &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">As</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, you <i class="calibre12">have</i>
    indeed <i class="calibre12">been</i> honest, and your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1402-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1402-1">c</a></sup></small>going out and
    your coming in
    with me in the army are pleasing in my sight; for I have not found evil in you since the day of your coming to me to
    this day. Nevertheless, you are not pleasing in the sight of the governors.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now then, return and go in peace, so that you will not
    do <i class="calibre12">anything</i> wrong in the sight of the governors of the Philistines.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>However, David said to Achish, &ldquo;But what have I
    done?
    And what have you found in your servant since the day that I came before you, to this day, that I cannot go and
    fight against the enemies of my lord the king?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But Achish replied to David, &ldquo;I know that you are
    pleasing in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, &lsquo;He must
    not
    go up with us into the battle.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now then, rise early in the morning with the servants
    of your lord who have come with you, and <i class="calibre12">as soon as</i> you have risen early in the morning and
    have light, leave.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So David got up early, he and his men, to leave in the
    morning to return to the land of the Philistines. And the Philistines went up to Jezreel.
