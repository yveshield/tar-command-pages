  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Rehoboam&rsquo;s Reign of Foolishness</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Rehoboam went to Shechem, because all Israel had come to
    Shechem to make him king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>When Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard <i
      class="calibre12">about it</i> (he was in Egypt where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon), Jeroboam
    returned from Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So they sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and summoned
    him. When Jeroboam and all Israel came, they spoke to Rehoboam, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&ldquo;Your father made our yoke hard; but now, lighten
    the
    hard labor <i class="calibre12">imposed by</i> your father and his heavy yoke which he put on us, and we will serve
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>He said to them, &ldquo;Return to me again in three
    days.&rdquo; So
    the people departed.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And then King
    Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2010-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2010-1">a</a></sup></small>served his father Solomon while
    he was still alive, saying, &ldquo;How do you advise <i class="calibre12">me</i> to answer this people?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>They spoke to him, saying, &ldquo;If you are kind to
    this
    people and please them and speak pleasant words to them, then they will be your servants always.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But he ignored the advice of the elders which they had
    given him, and consulted with the young men who had grown up with him <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2010-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2010-2">b</a></sup></small>and served him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>He said to them, &ldquo;What advice do you give, so that
    we
    may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, &lsquo;Lighten the yoke which your father put on
    us&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The young men who had grown up with him spoke to him,
    saying, &ldquo;This is what you should say to the people who spoke to you, saying: &lsquo;Your father made our yoke
    heavy,
    but
    you make it lighter for us!&rsquo; You should speak this way to them: &lsquo;My little finger is thicker than my
    father&rsquo;s
    waist!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Now then, my father loaded you with a heavy yoke; yet I
    will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I <i class="calibre12">will discipline you</i> with
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2010-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2010-3">c</a></sup></small>scorpions!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> So Jeroboam
    and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third day, just as the king had <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2011-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2011-1">d</a></sup></small>directed, saying, &ldquo;Return to me on the third
    day.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>The king answered them harshly, and King Rehoboam
    ignored the advice of the elders.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>He spoke to them according to the advice of the young
    men, saying, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2011-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2011-2">e</a></sup></small>My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to
    it; my father disciplined you with whips, but I <i class="calibre12">will discipline you</i> with <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2011-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2011-3">f</a></sup></small>scorpions.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So the king did not listen to the people, because it
    was a turn of events from God so that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> might establish His word, which He spoke
    through Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> When all
    Israel <i class="calibre12">saw</i> that the king had not listened to them, the people replied to the king, saying,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;What share do we have in David? </div>
  <div class="block"><i class="calibre12">We have</i> no inheritance in the son of Jesse. </div>
  <div class="block">Everyone to your tents, Israel! </div>
  <div class="block">Now look after your own house, David!&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    So all Israel went <i class="calibre12">away</i> to their tents.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But as for the sons of Israel who lived in the cities
    of Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of
    the forced labor, and the sons of Israel stoned him <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2012-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2012-1">g</a></sup></small>to death. And
    King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of
    David to this day.
