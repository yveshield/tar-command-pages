  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Jehoram the son of Ahab became king over Israel at Samaria
    in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned for twelve years.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He did evil in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, though not like his father and his mother; for he removed the memorial stone of Baal
    which his father had made.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Nevertheless, he clung to the sins of Jeroboam the son
    of Nebat, into which he misled Israel; he did not abandon them.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Now Mesha the
    king of Moab was a sheep breeder, and he used to make <i class="calibre12">tribute</i> payments to the king of
    Israel of a hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>However, when <i class="calibre12">King</i> Ahab died,
    the king of Moab broke with the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1707-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1707-1">a</a></sup></small>king of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So King Jehoram left Samaria <i class="calibre12">for
      battle</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1707-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1707-2">b</a></sup></small>at that time and mustered all Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he went and sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> to
    Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The king of Moab has broken away from me. Will you go with me to fight
    against Moab?&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;I will go up. <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1707-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1707-3">c</a></sup></small>Consider me
    yours, my people as
    your people, my horses as your horses.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;Which way shall we go up?&rdquo;
    And he
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1707-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1707-4">d</a></sup></small>answered, &ldquo;The way of the wilderness of
    Edom.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> So the king of
    Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom, and they made a circuit of seven days&rsquo; journey. But
    there
    was no water for the army or for the cattle that <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1708-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1708-1">e</a></sup></small>followed them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then the king of Israel said, &ldquo;It is hopeless!
    For the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has called these three kings to hand them over to Moab!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Is there no prophet of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> here, that we may inquire of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by him?&rdquo;
    And one
    of the king of Israel&rsquo;s servants answered and said, &ldquo;Elisha the son of Shaphat is here, who used to pour
    water
    on
    the hands of Elijah.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;The word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> is with him.&rdquo; So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down
    to
    him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now Elisha
    said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1709-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1709-1">f</a></sup></small>What business do you have with
    me? Go to your
    father&rsquo;s prophets and your mother&rsquo;s prophets.&rdquo; But the king of Israel said to him, &ldquo;No, for
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has called these three kings <i class="calibre12">together</i> to hand them
    over to
    Moab.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Elisha said, &ldquo;As <i class="calibre12">surely
      as</i> the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies lives, before whom I stand, if I did not respect Jehoshaphat the king of
    Judah, I would not look at you nor see you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But now bring me a <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1709-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1709-2">g</a></sup></small>musician.&rdquo; And it came about, when the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1709-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1709-2">g</a></sup></small>musician played, that the hand of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> came upon him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Make this valley <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1709-4" epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1709-3">h</a></sup></small>full of
    trenches.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says this:
    &lsquo;You will not see wind, nor will you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you will
    drink,
    you, your livestock, and your <i class="calibre12">other</i> animals.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And this is an insignificant thing in the sight of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; He will also give the Moabites into your hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then you shall strike every fortified city and every
    choice city, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1709-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1709-4">i</a></sup></small>cut down every good tree and stop up all the springs
    of water, and spoil every good plot of land with stones.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And it happened in the morning about <i
      class="calibre12">the time of</i> offering the sacrifice, that behold, water came from the direction of Edom, and
    the country was filled with water.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Now all the
    Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them. And all who were able to <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1710-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1710-1">j</a></sup></small>put on armor and older were summoned and they took
    their positions on the border.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then they got up early in the morning, and the sun
    shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water opposite <i class="calibre12">them</i> as red as blood.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So they said, &ldquo;This is blood; the kings must have
    fought each other, and they have killed one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoils!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the
    Israelites rose up and struck the Moabites, so that they fled from them; and <i class="calibre12">the Israelites</i>
    invaded <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1710-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1710-2">k</a></sup></small>the land, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1710-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1710-3">l</a></sup></small>killing the Moabites.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So they destroyed the cities; and each one threw a
    stone on every plot of good land and filled it. So they stopped up every spring of water and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1710-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1710-4">m</a></sup></small>cut down every good tree, until in Kir-hareseth <i
      class="calibre12">only</i> they left its stones; however, the rock slingers surrounded <i class="calibre12">it</i>
    and struck it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was too
    fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men who drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom; but they
    could not.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Then <i class="calibre12">the king of Moab</i> took his
    oldest son who was to reign in his place, and offered him as a burnt offering on the wall. And great anger came upon
    Israel, and they departed from him and returned to their own land.
