    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When they had finished, they brought the rest of the
    money before the king and Jehoiada; and it was made into utensils for the house of the L<span

    silver. And they offered burnt offerings in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> continually, all the
    days of Jehoiada.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now Jehoiada
