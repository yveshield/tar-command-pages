    <i class="calibre12">extra</i> oil with them;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>but the prudent ones took oil in flasks with their
    lamps.

    &lsquo;Lord,
    lord, open up for us.&rsquo;

    the one

    not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter <i class="calibre12">seed.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And I was afraid, so I went away and hid your talent in
