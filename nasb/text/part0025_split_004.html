            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of
            Shaphan,
            swore to them and to their men, saying, &ldquo;Do not be afraid of serving the Chaldeans; stay in the land
            and serve the
            king of Babylon, so that it may go well for you.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now as for me, behold, I am going to stay in

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Likewise, also all the Jews who were in Moab
            and among
            the sons of Ammon and in Edom, and who were in all the <i class="calibre12">other</i> countries, heard that
            the king

            to which
            they had been scattered and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer
            fruit in
            great abundance.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now
            Johanan

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>and said to him, &ldquo;Are you well aware that
            Baalis the

            son of
            Ahikam
            did not believe them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke secretly

            Gedaliah in Mizpah, saying, &ldquo;Let me go and kill Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no one will know!
            Why should he

            perish?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan
