    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> In his days Edom broke away <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2050-1">d</a></sup></small>from the rule of Judah, and appointed a king over
    themselves.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all
    his chariots with him. And he got up at night and struck and killed the Edomites who were surrounding him, and the
    commanders of the chariots.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So Edom revolted <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2050-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2050-2">e</a></sup></small>against Judah to this day. Then Libnah revolted at

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2050-3">f</a></sup></small>against his rule because he had abandoned the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God of his fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Furthermore, he made high places in the mountains of
    Judah, and caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful, and led Judah astray.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then a letter
    came to him from Elijah the prophet, saying, &ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of
    your
    father David says: &lsquo;Because you have not walked in the ways of your father Jehoshaphat and the ways of Asa
    king of
    Judah,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>but have walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and
    have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to be unfaithful as the house of Ahab was unfaithful, and you
    have also killed your brothers, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2051-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2051-1">g</a></sup></small>your own family, who were better
    than you,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>behold, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is going
    to strike your people, your sons, your wives, and all your possessions with a great plague;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>and you will suffer <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2051-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2051-2">h</a></sup></small>severe sickness, a disease of your bowels, until
    your bowels come out because of the sickness, day by day.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines and the Arabs who <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2052-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2052-1">i</a></sup></small>bordered the Ethiopians;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>and they came against Judah and invaded it, and carried
    away all the possessions found in the king&rsquo;s house together with his sons and his wives, so that no son was
    left to
    him except <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2052-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> So after all
    this the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> struck him in his intestines with an incurable sickness.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now it came about in the course of time, at the end of
    two years, that his bowels came out because of his sickness, and he died in great pain. And his people did not make
    a <i class="calibre12">funeral</i> fire for him like the fire for his fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>He was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he
    reigned in Jerusalem for eight years; and he departed <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    one&rsquo;s
    regret, and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
