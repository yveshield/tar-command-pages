            of the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>When all the flocks were gathered there, they
            would roll
            the stone from the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would put the stone back in its place on
            the
            mouth of the well.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Jacob

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So he said to them, &ldquo;Do you know Laban the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And he said to them, &ldquo;Is it well with
            him?&rdquo; And they
            said, &ldquo;It is well, and here is his daughter Rachel coming with the sheep.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;Look, it is still high day;
            it is not
            time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go, pasture them.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But they said, &ldquo;We cannot, until all the
            flocks are
            gathered, and they roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep.&rdquo;
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> While
            he was
            still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father&rsquo;s sheep, for she was a shepherdess.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>When Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of his
            mother&rsquo;s
            brother Laban, and the sheep of his mother&rsquo;s brother Laban, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from
            the
            mouth of the
            well, and watered the flock of his mother&rsquo;s brother Laban.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and raised his voice
            and
            wept.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Jacob told Rachel that he was a relative of her
            father
            and that he was Rebekah&rsquo;s son, and she ran and told her father.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> So
            when Laban
            heard the news about Jacob, his sister&rsquo;s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and
            brought him
            to his house. Then he told Laban all these things.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And Laban said to him, &ldquo;You certainly are
            my bone and
            my flesh.&rdquo; And he stayed with him a month.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then
            Laban
            said to Jacob, &ldquo;Because you are my relative, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what
            shall your
            wages be?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the
            older was
            Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And Leah&rsquo;s eyes were weak, but Rachel was
            beautiful in
            figure and appearance.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, &ldquo;I
            will serve you
            seven years for your younger daughter Rachel.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Laban said, &ldquo;It is better that I give her
            to you than
            to give her to another man; stay with me.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and
            they seemed
            to him like <i class="calibre12">only</i> a few days because of his love for her.

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So Laban gathered all the people of the place
            and held
            a feast.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Now in the evening he took his daughter Leah
            and
            brought her to him; and <i class="calibre12">Jacob</i> had relations with her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Laban also gave his female slave Zilpah to his
            daughter
            Leah as a slave.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So it came about in the morning that, behold,
            it was
            Leah! And he said to Laban, &ldquo;What is this <i class="calibre12">that</i> you have done to me? Was it
            not for Rachel
            that I served with you? Why then have you deceived me?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>But Laban said, &ldquo;It is not <small

            you the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Jacob did so and completed her week, and he
            gave him
            his daughter Rachel as his wife.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Laban also gave his female slave Bilhah to his

            Rachel as her slave.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So <i class="calibre12">Jacob</i> had relations
