      <p class="aleft">
            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the sons of Israel again did evil in the sight of
            the

            there was
            a man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was infertile and had not

            appeared to the woman and said to her, &ldquo;Behold now, you are infertile and have not given birth; but
            you will
            conceive and give birth to a son.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And now, be careful not to drink wine or strong

            begin to
            save Israel from the hands of the Philistines.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then the woman came and told her husband,
            saying, &ldquo;A man
            of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. So I did
            not ask
            him where he <i class="calibre12">came</i> from, nor did he tell me his name.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>But he said to me, &lsquo;Behold, you shall
            conceive
            and give

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Then
            Manoah

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So the woman hurried and ran, and told her

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And the angel of the L<span

            said to Manoah, &ldquo;The woman shall pay attention <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then
            Manoah

            said to Manoah, &ldquo;Though you detain me, I will not eat your <small class="small1"><sup

            you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo; For Manoah did not
            know
            that he was
            the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And Manoah said to the angel of the L<span

            you?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But the angel of the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span>
            said to him, &ldquo;Why do you ask my name, for it is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So Manoah took the young goat along with the
            grain
            offering and offered it on the rock to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and He performed wonders while
            Manoah
            and his wife looked on.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For it came about when the flame went up from
            the altar
            toward heaven, that the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> ascended in the flame of the altar.
            When
            Manoah and his wife saw <i class="calibre12">this,</i> they fell on their faces to the ground.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Now
            the angel
            of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> did not appear to Manoah or his wife again. Then Manoah knew that he
            was the
            angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So Manoah said to his wife, &ldquo;We will
            certainly die, for
            we have seen God.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But his wife said to him, &ldquo;If the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> had desired to kill us, He would not have accepted a burnt offering and a
            grain offering
            from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have let us hear <i

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> So
            the woman
            gave birth to a son, and named him Samson; and the child grew up and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
            blessed
            him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And the Spirit of the L<span
