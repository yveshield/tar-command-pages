    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let&rsquo;s cleanse
    ourselves from all defilement of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> Make room for
    us <i class="calibre12">in your hearts;</i> we have wronged no one, we corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of
    no one.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>I do not speak to condemn <i class="calibre12">you,</i>
    for I have said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.

    great. I am filled with comfort; I am overflowing with joy in all our affliction.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> For even when
    we came into Macedonia our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side: conflicts on the outside, fears
    inside.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But God, who comforts the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6985-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>and not only by his arrival, but also by the comfort
    with which he was comforted among you, as he reported to us your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me; so that I
    rejoiced even more.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>For though I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not
    regret it; though I did regret it—<i class="calibre12">for</i> I see that that letter caused you sorrow, though only
    for a while—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but
    that you were made sorrowful to <i class="calibre12">the point of</i> repentance; for you were made sorrowful
    according to <i class="calibre12">the will of</i> God, so that you might not suffer loss in anything <small

    regret, <i class="calibre12">leading</i> to salvation, but the sorrow of the world produces death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>For behold what earnestness this very thing, this

    <i class="calibre12">of yourselves,</i> what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment of
    wrong! In everything you demonstrated yourselves to be innocent in the matter.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So although I wrote to you, <i class="calibre12">it
      was</i> not for the sake of the offender nor for the sake of the one offended, but that your earnestness in our
    behalf might be made known to you in the sight of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Because of this, we have been comforted.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><b class="calibre9">A</b>nd besides our comfort, we rejoiced even
    much more for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.

    anything, I was not put to shame. But as we spoke all things to you in truth, so also our boasting before Titus
    proved to be <i class="calibre12">the</i> truth.
