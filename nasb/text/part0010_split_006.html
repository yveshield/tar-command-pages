            him saw
            that he was indeed prophesying with the prophets, that the people said to one another, &ldquo;What is this

            Saul&rsquo;s

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Saul said to his uncle, &ldquo;He told us

            Samuel
            brought all the tribes of Israel forward; and the tribe of Benjamin was selected by lot.

            by its
            families, and the Matrite family was selected by lot. And Saul the son of Kish was selected by lot; but when
            they
            looked for him, he could not be found.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Therefore they inquired further of the L<span

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So they ran and took him from there, and when
            he stood
            among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Samuel said to all the people, &ldquo;Do you
