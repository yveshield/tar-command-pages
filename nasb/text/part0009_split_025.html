            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then her mother-in-law Naomi said to her, &ldquo;My

            well for you?
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Now then, is Boaz not our relative, with whose
            young
            women you were? Behold, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Wash yourself therefore, and anoint yourself,
            and put on
            your <i class="calibre12">best</i> clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; <i class="calibre12">but</i>
            do not
            reveal yourself to the man until he has finished eating and drinking.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And it shall be when he lies down, that you
            shall <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1258-2" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And she said to her, &ldquo;All that you say I
            will do.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> So she
            went
            down to the threshing floor and did according to all that her mother-in-law had commanded her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was
            cheerful, he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain; and she came secretly, and uncovered his feet
            and lay
            down.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And it happened in the middle of the night that
            the man
            was startled and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1259-1" epub:type="noteref"

            woman was lying at his
            feet.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So he said, &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; And she
            answered, &ldquo;I am Ruth
            your slave. Now spread your garment over your slave, for you are a redeemer.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;May you be blessed of the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, my daughter. You have shown your last kindness to be better than the

            going after young men, whether poor or rich.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So now, my daughter, do not fear. I will do for

            whatever you say, for all <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1259-2"

            excellence.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But now, although it is true that I am a
            redeemer, yet
            there is also a redeemer more closely related than I.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Remain this night, and when morning comes, if
            he will

            you. But if he does
            not wish to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1259-4" epub:type="noteref"

            you, as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives. Lie down until morning.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> So
            she lay at
            his feet until morning, and got up before one person could recognize another; and he said, &ldquo;Do not let
            it be known
            that the woman came to the threshing floor.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Again he said, &ldquo;Give me the shawl that is
            on you and
            hold it.&rdquo; So she held it, and he measured six <i class="calibre12">measures</i> of barley and laid <i
                  class="calibre12">it</i> on her. Then <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>When she came to her mother-in-law, she said,

            she told her all
            that the man had done for her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>She also said, &ldquo;These six <i

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then she said, &ldquo;Wait, my daughter, until
