  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Naomi Widowed</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about in the days when the judges <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1250-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1250-1">a</a></sup></small>governed, that there was a famine in the land. And a
    man of Bethlehem in Judah went to reside in the land of Moab <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1250-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_026.html#f1250-2">b</a></sup></small>with his wife
    and his two sons.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>The name of the man <i class="calibre12">was</i>
    Elimelech, and the name of his wife, Naomi; and the names of his two sons <i class="calibre12">were</i> Mahlon and
    Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem in Judah. So they entered the land of Moab and remained there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Elimelech, Naomi&rsquo;s husband, died; and she was
    left
    with her two sons.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And they took for themselves Moabite women <i
      class="calibre12">as</i> wives; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other, Ruth. And they lived
    there about ten years.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1250-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_026.html#f1250-3">c</a></sup></small>both Mahlon
    and Chilion also died, and the woman was left without her two sons and her husband.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then she arose
    with her daughters-in-law to return from the land of Moab, because she had heard in the land of Moab that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had visited His people by giving them food.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So she departed from the place where she was, and her
    two daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, &ldquo;Go,
    return
    each of you to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1251-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1251-1">d</a></sup></small>your mother&rsquo;s house. May the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> deal kindly with you as you have dealt with the dead and with me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> grant that you
    may find a place of rest, each one in the house of her husband.&rdquo; Then she kissed them, and they raised their
    voices
    and wept.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>However, they said to her, &ldquo;<i
      class="calibre12">No,</i> but we will return with you to your people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But Naomi said, &ldquo;Return, my daughters. Why should
    you
    go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Return, my daughters! Go, for I am too old to have a
    husband. If I said I have hope, if I were even to have a husband tonight and also give birth to sons,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>would you therefore wait until they were grown? Would
    you therefore refrain from marrying? No, my daughters; for it is much more bitter for me than for you, because the
    hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has come out against me.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Ruth&rsquo;s Loyalty</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And they raised their voices and wept again; and Orpah
    kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then she
    said, &ldquo;Behold, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and her gods; return after your
    sister-in-law.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But Ruth said, &ldquo;Do not plead with me to leave you
    <i class="calibre12">or</i> to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you sleep, I
    will
    sleep. Your people <i class="calibre12">shall be</i> my people, and your God, my God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried.
    May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> do so to me, and worse, if <i class="calibre12">anything but</i> death
    separates <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1252-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1252-1">e</a></sup></small>me from you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>When she saw that she was determined to go with her,
    she stopped speaking to her <i class="calibre12">about it.</i>

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> So they both
    went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they had come to Bethlehem, all the city was stirred because of them,
    and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1253-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1253-1">f</a></sup></small>the women said, &ldquo;Is this Naomi?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But she said to them, &ldquo;Do not call me <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1253-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1253-2">g</a></sup></small>Naomi; call me <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0009_split_026.html#f1253-4">i</a></sup></small>the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>I went <i class="calibre12">away</i> full, but the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has brought me back empty. Why do you call me Naomi, since the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has testified against me and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1253-5" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_026.html#f1253-5">j</a></sup></small>the Almighty
    has afflicted me?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> So Naomi
    returned, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, who returned from the land of Moab. And they came to
    Bethlehem at the beginning of barley harvest.
