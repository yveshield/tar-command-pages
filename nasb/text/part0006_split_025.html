  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">A Law of Inheritance</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son
    of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph, came forward; and
    these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>They stood before Moses, before Eleazar the priest,
    before the leaders, and all the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>&ldquo;Our father died in the wilderness, yet he was not
    among
    the group of those who gathered together against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, in the group of Korah; but he
    died in his own sin, and he had no sons.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from
    among his family <i class="calibre12">simply</i> because he had no son? Give us property among our father&rsquo;s
    brothers.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So Moses brought their case before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source775-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f775-1">a</a></sup></small>Moses,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&ldquo;The daughters of Zelophehad are right<i
      class="calibre12"> about their</i> statements. You shall certainly give them hereditary property among their
    father&rsquo;s brothers, and you shall transfer the inheritance of their father to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Further, you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying,
    &lsquo;If a man dies and has no son, then you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And if he has no daughter, then you shall give his
    inheritance to his brothers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>If he has no brothers, then you shall give his
    inheritance to his father&rsquo;s brothers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And if his father has no brothers, then you shall give
    his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall take possession of it; and it shall be a
    statutory ordinance to the sons of Israel, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded
    Moses.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses, &ldquo;Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land which I
    have
    given to the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>When you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your
    people, just as Aaron your brother <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source776-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f776-1">b</a></sup></small>was;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>for in the wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the
    congregation, you rebelled against My <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source776-2"

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Joshua to Succeed Moses</i></p>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses,
    &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source777-4" epub:type="noteref"

    all the congregation, and commission him in their sight.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And you shall put some of your <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Moreover, he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Moses did just as the L<span
