            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>She *said to Him, &ldquo;Yes, Lord; I have come

            Jesus had
            not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha met Him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Then the Jews who were with her in the house
            and were
            consoling her, when they saw that Mary had gotten up quickly and left, they followed her, thinking that she
            was
            going to the tomb to weep there.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>So when Mary came <i class="calibre12">to the

            They *said to
            Him, &ldquo;Lord, come and see.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Jesus wept.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>So the Jews were saying, &ldquo;See how He
            loved him!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>But some of them said, &ldquo;Could this man,

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">38</b></span> So
            Jesus,
            again being deeply moved within, *came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying against it.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>Jesus *said, &ldquo;Remove the stone.&rdquo;
            Martha,

            believe, you will see the glory of God?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>So they removed the stone. And Jesus raised His
            eyes,
            and said, &ldquo;Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>But I knew that You always hear Me;

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">43</sup></small>And when He had said these things, He cried out

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>Out came the man who had died, bound hand and

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">45</b></span>
            Therefore
            many of the Jews who came to Mary, and saw what He had done, believed in Him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">46</sup></small>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told
