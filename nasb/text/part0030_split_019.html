  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> When <i class="calibre12">Jesus</i> came back to Capernaum a
    few days later, it was heard that He was at home.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And many were gathered together, so that there was no
    longer space, not even near the door; and He was speaking the word to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">some people</i> *came, bringing
    to Him a man who was paralyzed, carried by four <i class="calibre12">men.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And when they were unable to <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0031_split_009.html#f6211-2">b</a></sup></small>above Him; and after digging an opening, they let
    down the pallet on which the paralyzed man was lying.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And Jesus, seeing their faith, *said to the paralyzed
    man, &ldquo;Son, your sins are forgiven.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But some of the scribes were sitting there and thinking
    <i class="calibre12">it</i> over in their hearts,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&ldquo;Why does this man speak that way? He is
    blaspheming!
    Who can forgive sins except God alone?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Immediately Jesus, aware <small class="small1"><sup

    within themselves, *said to them, &ldquo;Why are you thinking about these things in your hearts?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Which is easier, to say to the paralyzed man,
    &lsquo;Your sins
    are forgiven&rsquo;; or to say, &lsquo;Get up, and pick up your pallet and walk&rsquo;?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has
    authority on earth to forgive sins&rdquo;â€”He *said to the paralyzed man,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>&ldquo;I say to you, get up, pick up your pallet, and
    go
    home.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And he got up and immediately picked up the pallet and
    went out in the sight of everyone, so that they were all amazed and were glorifying God, saying, &ldquo;We have
    never seen
    <i class="calibre12">anything</i> like this!&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> And He went
