            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>For when they came up from Egypt, and Israel

            also
            sent <i class="calibre12">messengers</i> to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained
            at Kadesh.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then they went through the wilderness and
            around the

            Arnon;
            but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon <i class="calibre12">was</i> the border of Moab.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the

            place.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through
            his
            territory; so Sihon gathered all his people and camped in Jahaz, and fought with Israel.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the

            so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So they possessed all the territory of the
            Amorites,
            from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness as far as the Jordan.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,

            possess it.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Now then, are you any better than Balak the son
            of

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>While Israel was living in Heshbon and its

            years, why
            did you not recover them within that time?
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So I have not sinned against you, but you are
            doing me
            wrong by making war against me. May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the Judge, judge today between the
