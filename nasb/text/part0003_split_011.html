    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then he commanded his house steward, saying, &ldquo;Fill the
    men&rsquo;s
    sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man&rsquo;s money in the opening of his sack.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And put my cup, the silver cup, in the opening of the
    sack of the youngest, and his money for the grain.&rdquo; And he did <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source213-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0003_split_017.html#f213-1">a</a></sup></small>as Joseph had

    was light, the men were sent away, they with their donkeys.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>They had <i class="calibre12">just</i> left the city, <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> were not far away, when Joseph said to his house steward, &ldquo;Up, follow the men; and
    when
    you overtake them, say to them, &lsquo;Why have you repaid evil for good?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Is this not <i class="calibre12">that</i> from which my
    lord drinks, and which he indeed uses for divination? You have done wrong in doing this!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> So <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source214-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f214-1">c</a></sup></small>he overtook them and spoke these words to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And they said to him, &ldquo;Why does my lord say such
    words
    as these? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Behold, the money which we found in the opening of our
    sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. How then could we steal silver or gold from your

    house?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>With whomever of your servants it is found, he shall
    die, and we also shall be my lord&rsquo;s slaves.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So he said, &ldquo;Now let it indeed be according to
    your
    words; he with whom it is found shall be my slave, but <i class="calibre12">the rest of</i> you shall be <i
      class="calibre12">considered</i> innocent.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then they hurried, each man lowered his sack to the
    ground, and each man opened his sack.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending
    with the youngest; and the cup was found in Benjamin&rsquo;s sack.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then they tore their clothes <i class="calibre12">in
      grief,</i> and when each man had loaded his donkey, they returned to the city.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> When Judah
    and his brothers came to Joseph&rsquo;s house, he was still there, and they fell down to the ground before him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Joseph said to them, &ldquo;What is this thing that you
    have
    done? Do you not know that a man who is like me can indeed practice divination?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Judah said, &ldquo;What can we say to my lord? What
    <i class="calibre12">words</i> can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the guilt of your

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But he said, &ldquo;Far be it from me to do this. The

    whose <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source215-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f215-2">e</a></sup></small>possession the cup has been found, he shall be my

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then Judah
    approached him and said, &ldquo;Oh my lord, may your servant please speak a word in my lord&rsquo;s ears, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source216-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f216-1">f</a></sup></small>do not be angry with your servant; for you are equal
    to Pharaoh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>My lord asked his servants, saying, &lsquo;Have you a
    father
    or a brother?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And we said to my lord, &lsquo;We have an old father
    and a
    little boy <i class="calibre12">born in our father&rsquo;s</i> old age. Now his brother is dead, so he alone is left
    of
    his mother, and his father loves him.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then you said to your servants, &lsquo;Bring him down
    to me
    so that I may set my eyes on him.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But we said to my lord, &lsquo;The boy cannot leave his
    father, for if he should leave his father, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source216-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0003_split_017.html#f216-2">g</a></sup></small>his father would die.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>You said to your servants, however, &lsquo;Unless your
    youngest brother comes down with you, you will not see my face again.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>So it came about when we went up to your servant my
    father, we told him the words of my lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And our father said, &lsquo;Go back, buy us a little
    food.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>But we said, &lsquo;We cannot go down. If our youngest
    brother is with us, then we will go down; for we cannot see the man&rsquo;s face unless our youngest brother is with
    us.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Then your servant my father said to us, &lsquo;You know
    that
    my wife bore me two sons;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>and the one left me, and I said, &ldquo;Surely he is
    torn to
    pieces,&rdquo; and I have not seen him since.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>If you also take this one from <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So now, when I come to your servant, my father, and the
    boy is not with us—since <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source216-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f216-5">j</a></sup></small>our father&rsquo;s life is so attached to the
    boy&rsquo;s life—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>when he sees that the boy is not <i
      class="calibre12">with us,</i> he will die. So your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant, our father,
    down to Sheol in sorrow.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>For your servant accepted responsibility for the boy
    from my father, saying, &lsquo;If I do not bring him <i class="calibre12">back</i> to you, then <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source216-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0003_split_017.html#f216-6">k</a></sup></small>my father can let me take the blame forever.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>So now, please let your servant remain as a slave to my
    lord instead of the boy, and let the boy go up with his brothers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>For how shall I go up to my father if the boy is not
    with me? <i class="calibre12">I fear</i> that I may see the evil that would <small class="small1"><sup
