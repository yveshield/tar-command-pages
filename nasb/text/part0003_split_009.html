            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob
            said to

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;Look, I have heard that

            and not die.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So ten of Joseph&rsquo;s brothers went down to
            buy
            grain from
            Egypt.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But Jacob did not send Joseph&rsquo;s brother
            Benjamin
            with
            his brothers, for he said, &ldquo;I am afraid that harm may happen to him.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So the sons of Israel came to buy grain among
            those who
            were coming, because the famine was <i class="calibre12">also</i> in the land of Canaan.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now
            Joseph was
            the ruler over the land; he was the one who sold grain to all the people of the land. And Joseph&rsquo;s
            brothers
            came and
            bowed down to him <i class="calibre12">with their</i> faces to the ground.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized
            them, but he
            disguised himself to them and spoke to them harshly. He said to them, &ldquo;Where have you come
            from?&rdquo; And
            they said,
            &ldquo;From the land of Canaan, to buy food.&rdquo;
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> But
            Joseph had
            recognized his brothers, although they did not recognize him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he <small

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And they said to him, &ldquo;No, my lord, but

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>We are all sons of one man; we are honest men,

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Yet he said to them, &ldquo;No, but you have

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But they said, &ldquo;Your servants are twelve

            youngest is with our
            father today, and one is no longer alive.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Yet Joseph said to them, &ldquo;It is as I said
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source204-4" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>by this you will be tested: by the life of
            Pharaoh, you
            shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here!
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Send one of you and have him get your brother,
            while
            you remain confined, so that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you. But if not, by the
            life of
            Pharaoh, you are certainly spies!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So he put them all together in prison for three
            days.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Now
            Joseph
            said to them on the third day, &ldquo;Do this and live, for I fear God:
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>if you are honest men, let one of your brothers

            your
            words may be verified, and you will not die.&rdquo; And they did so.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then they said to one another, &ldquo;Truly we

            listen;
            for that reason this distress has happened to us.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Reuben answered them, saying, &ldquo;Did I not

            required.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>They did not know, however, that Joseph
            understood, for
            there was an interpreter between them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then he turned away from them and wept. But
            when he
            returned to them and spoke to them, he took Simeon from them and bound him before their eyes.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then Joseph gave orders to fill their bags with
            grain,
            but <i class="calibre12">also</i> to return every man&rsquo;s money in his sack, and to give them provisions
            for
            the
            journey. And that is what was done for them.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> So
            they
            loaded their donkeys with their grain and departed from there.

            opened
            his sack to give his donkey feed at the overnight campsite, he saw his money; and behold, it was in the
            opening of
            his sack!
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So he said to his brothers, &ldquo;My money has
