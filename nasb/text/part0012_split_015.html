  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Elijah Taken to Heaven</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about, when the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    was about to bring Elijah up by a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1702-1"

    left Gilgal with Elisha.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Stay here please, for
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has sent me as far as Bethel.&rdquo; But Elisha said, &ldquo;As <i
      class="calibre12">surely
      as</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So they
    went
    down to Bethel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the sons of the prophets who <i
      class="calibre12">were at</i> Bethel went out to Elisha and said to him, &ldquo;Are you aware that the L<span

    today?&rdquo;
    And he said, &ldquo;Yes, I am aware; say nothing <i class="calibre12">about it.</i>&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> And Elijah
    said to him, &ldquo;Elisha, please stay here, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has sent me to
    Jericho.&rdquo; But
    he
    said, &ldquo;As <i class="calibre12">surely as</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, and as you yourself
    live, I
    will not leave you.&rdquo; So they came to Jericho.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then the sons of the prophets who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> at Jericho approached Elisha and said to him, &ldquo;Do you know that the L<span

    And he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1703-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1703-2">d</a></sup></small>answered, &ldquo;Yes, I know; say nothing <i
      class="calibre12">about it.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And Elijah said to him, &ldquo;Please stay here, for the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has sent me to the Jordan.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;As <i
      class="calibre12">surely
      as</i> the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you.&rdquo; So the two of them
    went on.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now fifty men
    of the sons of the prophets went and stood opposite <i class="calibre12">them</i> at a distance, while the two of
    them stood by the Jordan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And Elijah took his coat, folded it, and struck the
    waters, and they were divided here and there, so that the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> When they had
    crossed over, Elijah said to Elisha, &ldquo;Ask <i class="calibre12">me</i> what I should do for you before I am
    taken
    from you.&rdquo; And Elisha said, &ldquo;Please let a double portion of your spirit be upon me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>He said, &ldquo;You have asked a hard thing. <i
      class="calibre12">Nevertheless,</i> if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if not, it
    shall not be <i class="calibre12">so.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And as they were walking along and talking, behold, a
    chariot of fire <i class="calibre12">appeared</i> with horses of fire, and they separated the two of them. Then
    Elijah went up by a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1704-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1704-1">e</a></sup></small>whirlwind to heaven.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And Elisha was watching <i class="calibre12">it</i> and
    he was crying out, &ldquo;My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and its horsemen!&rdquo; And he did not see
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1704-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1704-2">f</a></sup></small>Elijah again. Then he took hold of his own clothes
    and tore them in two pieces.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>He also took up the coat of Elijah that had fallen from
    him, and he went back and stood by the bank of the Jordan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then he took the coat of Elijah that had fallen from
    him and struck the waters, and said, &ldquo;Where is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Elijah?&rdquo;
    And
    when he
    also had struck the waters, they were divided here and there; and Elisha crossed over.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Elisha Succeeds Elijah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now when the sons of the prophets who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> at Jericho opposite <i class="calibre12">him</i> saw him, they said, &ldquo;The spirit
    of
    Elijah has settled on Elisha.&rdquo; And they came to meet him and bowed down to the ground before him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then they said to him, &ldquo;Behold now, there are
    with your
    servants fifty strong men; please let them go and search for your master, in case the Spirit of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has taken him up and cast him on some mountain or into some valley.&rdquo; But he said,
    &ldquo;You
    shall not send <i class="calibre12">anyone.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Yet when they urged him until he was ashamed <i
      class="calibre12">to refuse,</i> he said, &ldquo;Send <i class="calibre12">them.</i>&rdquo; So they sent fifty
    men; and
    they
    searched for three days, but did not find him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>They returned to him while he was staying in Jericho;
    and he said to them, &ldquo;Did I not say to you, &lsquo;Do not go&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then the men
    of the city said to Elisha, &ldquo;Behold now, the site of the city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is
    bad and
    the land <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1705-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-1">g</a></sup></small>is unfruitful.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Bring me a new jar, and put salt
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1705-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-2">h</a></sup></small>in it.&rdquo; So they brought <i
      class="calibre12">it</i>
    to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then he went out to the spring of water and threw salt
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1705-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-3">i</a></sup></small>in it and said, &ldquo;This is what the L<span

          epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-4">j</a></sup></small>purified these waters; there
    shall not come from there death or <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1705-5"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-5">k</a></sup></small>unfruitfulness any
    longer.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So the waters have been <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1705-6">l</a></sup></small>purified to this day, in accordance with the word of
    Elisha which he spoke.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now he went
    up from there to Bethel; and as he was going up by the road, <i class="calibre12">some</i> young boys came out from
    the city and ridiculed him and said to him, &ldquo;Go up, you baldhead; go up, you baldhead!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>When he looked behind him and saw them, he cursed them
    in the name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. Then two female bears came out of the woods and tore up
    forty-two <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1706-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>He then went on from there to Mount Carmel, and from
    there he returned to Samaria.
