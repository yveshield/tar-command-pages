  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now these are <i class="calibre12">the territories</i> which
    the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads
    of the fathers&rsquo; <i class="calibre12">households</i> of the tribes of the sons of Israel apportioned to them as
    inheritances,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>by the lot of their inheritance, just as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> commanded <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1083-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1083-1">a</a></sup></small>through Moses, for the nine
    tribes and the half-tribe.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes
    and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give an inheritance to the Levites among them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
    Ephraim, and they did not give a portion to the Levites in the land, except cities to live in, with their pasture
    lands for their livestock and for their property.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>The sons of Israel did exactly as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then the sons
    of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, &ldquo;You know the
    word
    which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Moses the man of God on account of <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1084-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1084-1">b</a></sup></small>you and me in Kadesh-barnea.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent me from Kadesh-barnea to spy out the land, and I brought word back to him as
    <i class="calibre12">it was</i> in my heart.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the
    heart of the people <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1084-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1084-2">c</a></sup></small>melt <i class="calibre12">with fear;</i> but I
    followed the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> my God fully.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So Moses swore on that day, saying, &lsquo;The land on
    which
    your foot has walked shall certainly be an inheritance to you and to your children forever, because you have
    followed the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> my God fully.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And now behold, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    has let me live, just as He spoke, these forty-five years, from the time that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    spoke this word to Moses, when Israel walked in the wilderness; and now behold, I am eighty-five years old today.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>I am still as strong today as I was on the day Moses
    sent me; as my strength was then, so my strength is now, for war and for going out and coming in.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Now then, give me this hill country about which the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke on that day, for you heard on that day that Anakim <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will
    be with me, and I will <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1084-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1084-3">d</a></sup></small>drive them out just as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has spoken.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> So Joshua
    blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the
    son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel
    fully.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Now the name of Hebron was previously <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1085-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1085-1">e</a></sup></small>Kiriath-arba; <i class="calibre12">for Arba</i> was
    the greatest man among the Anakim. Then the land was at rest from war.
