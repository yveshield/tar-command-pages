  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Plans to Move the Ark to Jerusalem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now <i class="calibre12">David</i> built houses for himself in
    the city of David; and he prepared a place for the ark of God and pitched a tent for it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then David said, &ldquo;No one is to carry the ark of
    God
    except the Levites; for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> chose them to carry the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and to serve Him forever.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And David assembled all Israel at Jerusalem to bring up
    the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to its place which he had prepared for it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>David gathered together the sons of Aaron and the
    Levites:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>of the sons of Kohath, Uriel the chief, and 120 of his
    relatives;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>of the sons of Merari, Asaiah the chief, and 220 of his
    relatives;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>of the sons of Gershom, Joel the chief, and 130 of his
    relatives;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>of the sons of Elizaphan, Shemaiah the chief, and two
    hundred of his relatives;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the chief, and eighty of
    his relatives;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>of the sons of Uzziel, Amminadab the chief, and 112 of
    his relatives.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then David
    called for the priests Zadok and Abiathar, and for the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and
    Amminadab;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and he said to them, &ldquo;You are the heads of the
    fathers&rsquo;
    <i class="calibre12">households</i> of the Levites; consecrate yourselves, you and your relatives, so that you may
    bring up the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel to <i class="calibre12">the place</i> that I
    have prepared for it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Because you did not <i class="calibre12">carry it</i>
    at the first, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God made an outburst against us, since we did not seek Him
    according to the ordinance.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves
    to bring up the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>The sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their
    shoulders with the poles on them, just as Moses had commanded in accordance with the word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then David
    spoke to the chiefs of the Levites to appoint their relatives <i class="calibre12">as</i> the singers, with musical
    instruments, harps, lyres, and cymbals, playing to raise sounds of joy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel, and
    from his relatives, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and from the sons of Merari their relatives, Ethan the son of
    Kushaiah,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>and with them their relatives of the second rank,
    Zechariah, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1908-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1908-1">a</a></sup></small>Ben, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab,
    Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, the gatekeepers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, <i
      class="calibre12">were appointed</i> to sound aloud cymbals of bronze;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>and Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab,
    Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with harps <i class="calibre12">tuned</i> to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1908-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0014_split_010.html#f1908-2">b</a></sup></small>alamoth;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel,
    and Azaziah, to lead with <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1908-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1908-3">c</a></sup></small>lyres <i class="calibre12">tuned</i> to the
    sheminith.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was <i
      class="calibre12">in charge of</i> the singing; he gave instruction in singing because he was skillful.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Berechiah and Elkanah were gatekeepers for the ark.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah,
    Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, blew the trumpets before the ark of God. Obed-edom and Jehiah also <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> gatekeepers for the ark.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> So <i
      class="calibre12">it was</i> David, with the elders of Israel and the captains of thousands, who went to bring up
    the ark of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> from the house of Obed-edom with joy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Because God was helping the Levites who were carrying
    the ark of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Now David was clothed with a robe of fine linen with
    all the Levites who were carrying the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the leader of the singing <i
      class="calibre12">with</i> the singers. David also wore an ephod of linen.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with shouting, and with <i class="calibre12">the</i> sound of the horn, with
    trumpets, with loud-sounding cymbals, with harps, and lyres.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">29</b></span> When the ark
    of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to the city of David, Michal the daughter of Saul
    looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and celebrating; and she despised him in her heart.
