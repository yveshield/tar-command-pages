  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to
    me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Son of man, prophesy against the prophets of
    Israel who
    prophesy, and say to those who prophesy from their own <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source5248-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0027_split_013.html#f5248-1">a</a></sup></small>inspiration,
    &lsquo;Listen to the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>This is what the Lord <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5248-2">b</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span> says: &ldquo;Woe to
    the
    foolish prophets who are following their own spirit and have seen nothing!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Israel, your prophets have been like jackals among
    ruins.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>You have not gone up into the breaches, nor did you
    build up a stone wall around the house of Israel to stand in the battle on the day of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>They see deceit and lying divination, those who are
    saying, &lsquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> declares,&rsquo; when the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has
    not
    sent
    them; yet they wait for the fulfillment of <i class="calibre12">their</i> word!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Did you not see a false vision and tell a lying
    divination when you said, &lsquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> declares,&rsquo; but it is not I who have
    spoken?&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Therefore,
    this is what the Lord G<span class="small1">OD</span> says: &ldquo;Because you have spoken deceit and have seen a
    lie,
    therefore behold, I am against you,&rdquo; declares the Lord G<span class="small1">OD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>&ldquo;So My hand will be against the prophets who see
    false
    visions and utter lying divinations. They will <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5249-1"

    My people, nor will they be written down in the register of the house of Israel, nor will they enter the land of
    Israel, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5249-2" epub:type="noteref"

      class="small1">OD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>It is definitely because they have misled My people by
    saying, &lsquo;Peace!&rsquo; when there is no peace. And when anyone builds a wall, behold, they plaster it over
    with
    whitewash;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small><i class="calibre12">so</i> tell those who plaster <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> over with whitewash, that it will fall. A flooding rain will come, and you, hailstones,
    will fall, and a violent wind will break out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Behold, <i class="calibre12">when</i> the wall has
    fallen, will you not be asked, &lsquo;Where is the plaster with which you plastered <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Therefore, this is what the Lord G<span
      class="small1">OD</span> says: &ldquo;I will make a violent wind break out in My wrath. There will also be in My
    anger a
    flooding rain and hailstones to consume <i class="calibre12">it</i> in wrath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So I will tear down the wall which you plastered over
    with whitewash and hurl it down to the ground, so that its foundation is exposed; and when it falls, you will perish
    in its midst. And you will know that I am the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So I will expend My wrath on the wall and on those who
    have plastered it over with whitewash; and I will say to you, &lsquo;The wall <small class="small1"><sup
