  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> when King Zedekiah sent to him Pashhur the son of Malchijah and Zephaniah the priest,
    the son of Maaseiah, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Please inquire of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>
    in our behalf, because Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is making war against us; perhaps the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> But Jeremiah
    said to them, &ldquo;You shall say to Zedekiah as follows:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&lsquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the
    God of Israel says: &ldquo;Behold, I am going to turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which you
    are
    making war against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the wall; and I will gather
    them into the middle of this city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And I Myself will make war against you with an
    outstretched hand and a mighty arm, and in anger, wrath, and great indignation.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>I will also strike the inhabitants of this city, both
    the people and the animals; they will die of a great plague.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then afterward,&rdquo; declares the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, &ldquo;I will hand Zedekiah king of Judah, his servants, and the people, that is, those
    who
    survive in this city from the plague, the sword, and the famine, over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, to their
    enemies, and to those who seek their lives; and he will strike and kill them with the edge of the sword. He will not
    spare them nor have pity nor compassion.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> &ldquo;You

    you
    the way of life and the way of death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small><i class="calibre12">Anyone</i> who stays in this city
    will die by the sword, by famine, or by plague; but <i class="calibre12">anyone</i> who leaves and goes over to the
    Chaldeans who are besieging you will live, and he will have his own life as plunder.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>For I have set My face against this city for harm and
    not for good,&rdquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. &ldquo;It will be handed over to the king of
