    returned from pursuing the Philistines, it was reported to him, saying, &ldquo;Behold, David is in the wilderness of
    Engedi.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men from all Israel
    and went to search for David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Mountain Goats.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And he came to the sheepfolds on the way, where there <i
      class="calibre12">was</i> a cave; and Saul went in to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses of the cave.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then David&rsquo;s men said to him, &ldquo;Behold, <i
      class="calibre12">this is</i> the day of which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to you, &lsquo;Behold; I
    am
    about to hand your enemy over to you, and you shall do to him as it seems good <small class="small1"><sup

    cut off
    the
    edge of Saul&rsquo;s robe secretly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>But it came about afterward that David&rsquo;s <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1379-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1379-4">d</a></sup></small>conscience bothered him because he had cut off the
    edge of Saul&rsquo;s <i class="calibre12">robe.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So he said to his men, &ldquo;Far be it from me because
    of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> that I would do this thing to my lord, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointed, to reach out with my hand against him,
    since he is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointed.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And David rebuked his men with <i
      class="calibre12">these</i> words and did not allow them to rise up against Saul. And Saul got up, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1379-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1379-5">e</a></sup></small>left the cave, and went on <i
      class="calibre12">his</i> way.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Afterward,
    however, David got up and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, saying, &ldquo;My lord the king!&rdquo; And
    when
    Saul
    looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and prostrated himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And David said to Saul, &ldquo;Why do you listen to the
    words
    of men <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1380-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1380-1">f</a></sup></small>who say, &lsquo;Behold, David is seeking <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Behold, this day your eyes have seen that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had handed you over to me today in the cave, and <i class="calibre12">someone</i> said
    to kill you, but <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1380-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1380-3">h</a></sup></small>I spared you; and I said, &lsquo;I will not reach
    out with
    my hand against my lord, because he is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    anointed.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So, my father, look! Indeed, look at the edge of your
    robe in my hand! For by <i class="calibre12">the fact</i> that I cut off the edge of your robe but did not kill you,
    know and understand that there is no evil or <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1380-4"

    have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait for my life, to take it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> judge between
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1380-5" epub:type="noteref"

      class="small1">ORD</span> take vengeance on you for me; but my hand shall not be against you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>As the proverb of the ancients says, &lsquo;Out of the
    wicked
    comes wickedness&rsquo;; but my hand shall not be against you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>After whom has the king of Israel gone out? Whom are
    you pursuing? A dead dog, a single flea?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> therefore be
    judge and decide between <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1380-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1380-6">k</a></sup></small>you and me; and may He see and plead my cause and
    save me from your hand.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> When David
    had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, &ldquo;Is this your voice, my son David?&rdquo; Then Saul
    raised his
    voice
    and wept.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And he said to David, &ldquo;You are more righteous
    than I;
    for you have dealt well with me, while I have dealt maliciously with you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>You have declared today that you have done good to me,
    that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> handed me over to you and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> you did not kill
    me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Though if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go
    away <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1381-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1381-1">l</a></sup></small>unharmed? May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    therefore reward you with good in return for what you have done to me this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Now, behold, I know that you will certainly be king,
    and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So now swear to me by the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> that you will not cut off my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1381-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1381-2">m</a></sup></small>descendants
    after me, and that you will not eliminate my name from my father&rsquo;s household.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And David swore <i class="calibre12">an oath</i> to
    Saul. Then Saul went to his home, but David and his men went up to the stronghold.
