    eighteenth year of King Josiah, the king sent Shaphan, the son of Azaliah the son of Meshullam the scribe, to the

    have found the Book of the Law in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo; And Hilkiah gave the
    book to
    Shaphan, who read it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Shaphan the scribe came to the king and brought
    back word to the king and said, &ldquo;Your servants have emptied out the money that was found in the house, and
    have
    handed it over to the workmen who have the oversight of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Moreover, Shaphan the scribe informed the king, saying,

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> When the king
    heard the words of the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes.

    for me and for the people and all Judah concerning the words of this book that has been found, for the wrath of the

    son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe (and she lived in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter); and they spoke to her.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then she said to them, &ldquo;This is what the L<span

    says: &lsquo;Behold, I am going to bring disaster on this place and on its inhabitants, all the words of the book
    which
    the king of Judah has read.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Since they have abandoned Me and have burned incense to
    other gods so that they may provoke Me to anger with all the work of their hands, My wrath burns against this place,
    and it shall not be quenched.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But to the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, this is what you shall say to him: &ldquo;This is what the L<span

    have
    heard,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>since your heart was tender and you humbled yourself
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> when you heard what I spoke against this place and against its
    inhabitants, that they would become an object of horror and a curse, and you have torn your clothes and wept before
    Me, I have indeed heard you,&rsquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Therefore, behold, I am going to gather you to your
    fathers, and you will be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes will not look at all the devastation that I
    am going to bring on this place.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So they brought back word to the king.
