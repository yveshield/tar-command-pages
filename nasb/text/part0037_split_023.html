  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Angel and the Little Scroll</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> I saw another strong angel coming down from heaven, clothed
    with a cloud; and the rainbow was on his head, and his face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and he had in his hand a little scroll, which was open.
    He placed his right foot on the sea and his left on the land;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and he cried out with a loud voice, as when a lion
    roars; and when he had cried out, the seven peals of thunder <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source7354-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0037_split_035.html#f7354-1">a</a></sup></small>uttered their
    voices.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>When the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about
    to write; and I heard a voice from heaven, saying, &ldquo;Seal up the things which the seven peals of thunder have
    spoken,
    and do not write them.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the
    land raised his right hand to heaven,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created
    heaven and the things in it, and the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there will
    no longer be a delay,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when
    he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as He announced to His servants the prophets.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Then the voice
    which I heard from heaven, <i class="calibre12">I heard</i> again speaking with me, and saying, &ldquo;Go, take the
    scroll
    which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And I went to the angel, telling him to give me the
    little scroll. And he *said to me, &ldquo;Take it and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it
    will
    be sweet as honey.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>I took the little scroll from the angel&rsquo;s hand
    and ate
    it, and in my mouth it was sweet as honey; and when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And they *said to me, &ldquo;You must prophesy again
    concerning many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.&rdquo;
