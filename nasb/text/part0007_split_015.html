    He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, so that you may drive them out and eliminate them quickly,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Remember, do not forget how you provoked the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God to anger in the wilderness; from the day that you left the land of Egypt until
    you arrived at this place, you have been rebellious against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Even at Horeb you provoked the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> to anger, and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was so angry with you that He would
    have destroyed you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>When I went up to the mountain to receive the tablets of
    stone, the tablets of the covenant which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> made with you, then I remained on the
    mountain for forty days and nights; I neither ate bread nor drank water.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> gave me the two
    tablets of stone written by the finger of God; and on them <i class="calibre12">were</i> all the words which the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had spoken with you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the
    assembly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>It came about at the end of forty days and nights that
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me,
    &lsquo;Arise, go down from here quickly, because your people, whom you brought out of Egypt, have behaved corruptly.
    They
    have quickly turned aside from the way that I commanded them; they have made a cast metal image for
    themselves.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> also said to
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source863-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f863-2">g</a></sup></small>me, &lsquo;I have seen this people, and indeed, it is
    a
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source863-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f863-3">h</a></sup></small>stubborn people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Leave Me alone, that I may destroy them and wipe out
    their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.&rsquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> &ldquo;So I
    turned
    and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were
    in my two hands.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God. You had made for yourselves a cast metal image of a calf; you had quickly
    turned aside from the way that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from
    my two hands, and smashed them to pieces before your eyes!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then I fell down before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> like the first <i class="calibre12">time,</i> for forty days and nights; I neither ate
    bread nor drank water, because of all your sin which you had committed by doing what was evil in the sight of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, to provoke Him to anger.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>For I was afraid of the anger and the rage with which
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was angry with you so as to destroy you; but the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> listened to me that time as well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was also angry
    enough with Aaron to destroy him; so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And I took your <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source864-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f864-1">i</a></sup></small>sinful <i class="calibre12">thing</i> which you had
    made, the calf, and burned it in the fire and crushed it, grinding it thoroughly until it was as fine as dust; and I
    threw its dust into the stream that came down from the mountain.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> &ldquo;Then
    at
    Taberah, at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah you kept provoking the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to anger.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And when the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent you
    from Kadesh-barnea, saying, &lsquo;Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you,&rsquo; you rebelled
    against the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source865-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f865-1">j</a></sup></small>command of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your
    God; you neither trusted Him nor listened to His voice.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>You have been rebellious toward the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> since the day I knew you.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> &ldquo;So I
    fell
    down before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> for the forty days and nights, which I <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source866-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f866-1">k</a></sup></small>did because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said
    He would destroy you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And I prayed to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    and said, &lsquo;Lord G<span class="small1">OD</span>, do not destroy Your people, Your inheritance, whom You have
    redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought out of Egypt with a mighty hand!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Remember Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do
    not turn Your attention to the stubbornness of this people, or to their wickedness, or their sin.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Otherwise, the <i class="calibre12">people of the</i>
    land from which You brought us will say, &ldquo;Since the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was not able to bring
    them into
    the land which He had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source866-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f866-2">l</a></sup></small>promised them, and since He hated them, He has
    brought them out to kill them in the wilderness!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Yet they are Your people, and Your inheritance, whom
    You brought out by Your great power and Your outstretched arm.&rsquo;
