  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David&rsquo;s Messengers Abused</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about after this, that Nahash the king of the sons
    of Ammon died, and his son became king in his place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then David said, &ldquo;I will show kindness to Hanun
    the son
    of Nahash, because his father showed kindness to me.&rdquo; So David sent messengers to console him concerning his
    father.
    And David&rsquo;s servants came into the land of the sons of Ammon to Hanun to console him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But the commanders among the sons of Ammon said to
    Hanun, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1928-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1928-1">a</a></sup></small>Do you think that David is honoring your father, in
    that he has sent comforters to you? Have his servants not come to you to search, to demolish, and to spy out the
    land?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants and shaved them,
    and cut
    off their robes in the middle as far as their buttocks, and sent them away.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then <i class="calibre12">certain people</i> went and
    told David about the men. And he sent <i class="calibre12">messengers</i> to meet them, because the men were very
    humiliated. And the king said, &ldquo;Stay at Jericho until your beards grow <i class="calibre12">back,</i> then
    return.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> When the sons
    of Ammon saw that they had made themselves repulsive to David, Hanun and the sons of Ammon sent <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1929-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1929-1">b</a></sup></small>a thousand talents of silver to hire for themselves
    chariots and horsemen from Mesopotamia, Aram-maacah, and Zobah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So they hired for themselves thirty-two thousand
    chariots, and the king of Maacah and his people, who came and camped opposite Medeba. And the sons of Ammon gathered
    together from their cities and came to the battle.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When David heard <i class="calibre12">about it,</i> he
    sent Joab and all the army, the mighty men.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>The sons of Ammon came out and drew up in battle
    formation at the entrance of the city; and the kings who had come were by themselves in the field.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Ammon and Aram Defeated</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Now when Joab saw that the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1930-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1930-1">c</a></sup></small>battle was set against him at the front and at the
    rear, he selected <i class="calibre12">warriors</i> from all the choice men in Israel and lined <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> up against the Arameans.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But the remainder of the people he placed <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1930-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1930-2">d</a></sup></small>under the command of <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1930-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1930-3">e</a></sup></small>Abshai his brother; and they lined up against the
    sons of Ammon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>He said, &ldquo;If the Arameans are too strong for me,
    then
    you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will help you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Be strong, and let&rsquo;s show ourselves courageous
    for the
    benefit of our people and the cities of our God; and may the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> do what is good in His
    sight.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So Joab and the people who were with him advanced to
    battle against the Arameans, and they fled from him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans had fled,
    they also fled from his brother Abshai and entered the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> When the
    Arameans saw that they had been <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1931-1"

    messengers and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the <i class="calibre12">Euphrates</i> River, with Shophach

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>When it was reported to David, he gathered all Israel
    together and crossed the Jordan, and came upon them and drew up in formation against them. And when David drew up in
    battle formation against the Arameans, they fought against him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And the Arameans fled from Israel, and David killed of
    the Arameans seven thousand charioteers and forty thousand foot soldiers; and he put Shophach the commander of the
    army to death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So when the servants of Hadadezer saw that they had
    been <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1931-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1931-3">h</a></sup></small>defeated by Israel, they made peace with David and
    served him. So the Arameans were not willing to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
