  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> When Jesus had spoken these words, He went away with His
    disciples across the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6612-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6612-1">a</a></sup></small>ravine of the Kidron, where there was a garden which
    He entered <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6612-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6612-2">b</a></sup></small>with His disciples.

    had often met there with His disciples.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Judas, having obtained the <i

    Pharisees, *came there with lanterns, torches, and weapons.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming
    upon Him, came out <i class="calibre12">into the open</i> and *said to them, &ldquo;Whom are you seeking?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>They answered Him, &ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo; He
    *said
    to
    them, &ldquo;I am <i class="calibre12">He.</i>&rdquo; And Judas also, who was betraying Him, was standing with them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now then, when He said to them, &ldquo;I am <i
      class="calibre12">He,</i>&rdquo; they drew back and fell to the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>He then asked them again, &ldquo;Whom are you
    seeking?&rdquo;
    And
    they said, &ldquo;Jesus the Nazarene.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I told you that I am <i
      class="calibre12">He;</i> so if you are seeking Me, let these <i class="calibre12">men</i> go on their way.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small><i class="calibre12">This took place</i> so that the
    word which He spoke would be fulfilled: &ldquo;Of those whom You have given Me I lost not one.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Simon Peter, since he had a sword, drew it and
    struck the high priest&rsquo;s slave, and cut off his right ear; and the slave&rsquo;s name was Malchus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So Jesus said to Peter, &ldquo;Put the sword into the
    sheath;
    the cup which the Father has given Me, am I not to drink it?&rdquo;

    Jesus and bound Him,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>and brought Him to Annas first; for he was the
    father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Now Caiaphas was the one who had advised the Jews that
    it was in their best interest for one man to die in behalf of the people.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Simon Peter
    was following Jesus, and <i class="calibre12">so was</i> another disciple. Now that disciple was known to the high
    priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>but Peter was standing at the door outside. So the
    other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the doorkeeper, and brought Peter in.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then the slave woman who was the doorkeeper *said to
    Peter, &ldquo;You are not also <i class="calibre12">one</i> of this Man&rsquo;s disciples, are you?&rdquo; He *said,
    &ldquo;I am
    not.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now the slaves and the officers were standing <i
      class="calibre12">there,</i> having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold and they were warming themselves; and
    Peter was also with them, standing and warming himself.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> The high
    priest then questioned Jesus about His disciples, and about His teaching.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;I have spoken openly to the
    world;
    I always taught in <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6614-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6614-1">g</a></sup></small>synagogues and in the temple <i
      class="calibre12">area,</i> where all the Jews congregate; and I said nothing in secret.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Why are you asking Me? Ask those who have heard what I
    spoke to them. Look: these people know what I said.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But when He said this, one of the officers, who was
    standing nearby, struck Jesus, saying, &ldquo;Is that the way You answer the high priest?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Jesus answered him, &ldquo;If I have spoken wrongly,
    testify
    of the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike Me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Peter&rsquo;s Denial of Jesus</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Now Simon Peter was <i class="calibre12">still</i> standing
    and warming himself. So they said to him, &ldquo;You are not <i class="calibre12">one</i> of His disciples as well,
    are
    you?&rdquo; He denied <i class="calibre12">it,</i> and said, &ldquo;I am not.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>One of the slaves of the high priest, who was related
    to the one whose ear Peter cut off, *said, &ldquo;Did I not see you in the garden with Him?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Peter then denied <i class="calibre12">it</i> again,
    and immediately a rooster crowed.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus before Pilate</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Then they *brought Jesus from Caiaphas into the <small

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6615-1">h</a></sup></small>Praetorium, and it was early; and they themselves
    did not enter the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6615-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6615-1">h</a></sup></small>Praetorium, so that they would not be defiled, but
    might eat the Passover.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Therefore Pilate came out to them and *said,
    &ldquo;What
    accusation are you bringing against this Man?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>They answered and said to him, &ldquo;If this Man were
    not

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6615-2">i</a></sup></small>a criminal, we would not have handed Him over to
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>So Pilate said to them, &ldquo;Take Him yourselves, and
    judge
    Him according to your law.&rdquo; The Jews said to him, &ldquo;We are not <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6615-4" epub:type="noteref"

    put anyone to death.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small><i class="calibre12">This happened</i> so that the word
    of Jesus which He said, indicating what kind of death He was going to die, would be fulfilled.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">33</b></span> Therefore
    Pilate entered the Praetorium again, and summoned Jesus and said to Him, &ldquo;You are the King of the Jews?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;Are you saying this <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6616-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Pilate answered, &ldquo;I am not a Jew, am I? Your own
    nation
    and the chief priests handed You over to me; what have You done?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;My kingdom is not of this world.
    If My
    kingdom were of this world, My servants would be fighting so that I would not be handed over to the Jews; but as it
    is, My kingdom is not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6616-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6616-2">l</a></sup></small>of this realm.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Therefore Pilate said to Him, &ldquo;So You are a
    king?&rdquo;
    Jesus answered, &ldquo;You say <i class="calibre12">correctly</i> that I am a king. For this <i
      class="calibre12">purpose</i> I have been born, and for this I have come into the world: to testify to the truth.
    Everyone who is of the truth listens to My voice.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Pilate *said to Him, &ldquo;What is truth?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><b class="calibre9">A</b>nd after saying this, he came out again to
    the Jews and *said to them, &ldquo;I find no grounds at all for charges in <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>So they shouted again, saying, &ldquo;Not this Man, but
