    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now concerning food sacrificed to idols, we know that we all
    have knowledge. Knowledge <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6921-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>If anyone thinks that he knows anything, he has not yet
    known as he ought to know;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>but if anyone loves God, he is known by Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Therefore,
    concerning the eating of food sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6922-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6922-1">b</a></sup></small>nothing at all in the world, and that there is no
    God but one.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For even if there are so-called gods whether in heaven
    or on earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>yet for us there is <i class="calibre12">only</i> one
    God, the Father, from whom are all things, and we <i class="calibre12">exist</i> for Him; and one Lord, Jesus
    Christ, by whom are all things, and we <i class="calibre12">exist</i> through Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> However, not
    all people have this knowledge; but some, being accustomed to the idol until now, eat <i class="calibre12">food</i>
    as if it were sacrificed to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Now food will not bring us <small class="small1"><sup

    block to the weak.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>For if someone sees you, the one who has knowledge,
    dining in an idol&rsquo;s temple, will his conscience, if he is weak, not be strengthened to eat things sacrificed
    to
    idols?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>For through your knowledge the one who is weak is
    ruined, the brother <i class="calibre12">or sister</i> for whose sake Christ died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And so, by sinning against the brothers <i
      class="calibre12">and sisters</i> and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Therefore, if food causes my brother to sin, I will
    never eat meat again, so that I will not cause my brother to sin.
