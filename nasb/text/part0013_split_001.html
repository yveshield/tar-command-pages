    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> In the second year of Joash son of Joahaz king of Israel,
    Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah became king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he
    reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>He did what was right in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, yet not like his father David; he acted in accordance with everything that his father
    Joash had done.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Only the high places were not eliminated; the people
    still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now it came about, as soon as the kingdom was firmly in
    his hand, that he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1772-1" epub:type="noteref"

    of Moses, as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> commanded, saying, &ldquo;The fathers shall not be put to death

    this day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Then Amaziah
    sent messengers to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1774-1" epub:type="noteref"

    Israel, saying, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s face each other <i class="calibre12">in combat.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But Jehoash king of Israel sent <i
      class="calibre12">messengers</i> to Amaziah king of Judah, saying, &ldquo;The thorn bush that was in Lebanon sent

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> But Amaziah
    would not listen. So Jehoash king of Israel went up; and they faced each other, he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
    Beth-shemesh, which belongs to Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And Judah was defeated by Israel, and they fled, every
    man to his tent.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then Jehoash king of Israel captured Amaziah king of
    Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh, and came to Jerusalem and tore down the wall of

    utensils which were found in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and in the treasuries of the
    king&rsquo;s
    house, the hostages as well, and returned to Samaria.
