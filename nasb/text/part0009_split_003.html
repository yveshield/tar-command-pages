    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came up
    from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, &ldquo;I brought you up out of Egypt and led you into the land which I have
    sworn to
    your fathers; and I said, &lsquo;I will never break My covenant with you,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and as for you, you shall not make a covenant with the
    inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.&rsquo; But you have not <small class="small1"><sup

      that</i> you have done?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Therefore I also said, &lsquo;I will not drive them out

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now when the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, the people raised their voices and wept.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So they named that place <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1134-3" epub:type="noteref"

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Joshua Dies</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> When Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel went,
    each one to his inheritance, to take possession of the land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The people served the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which He had done for Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, died at the age of 110.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance
    in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>All that generation also were gathered to their
    fathers; and another generation rose up after them who did not know the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, nor even
    the work which He had done for Israel.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel Serves the Baals</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then the sons of Israel did evil in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1136-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1136-1">e</a></sup></small>served the Baals,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and they abandoned the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt, and they
    followed other gods from the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them; so they provoked the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to anger.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>They abandoned the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and
    served Baal and the Ashtaroth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then the anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    burned against Israel, and He handed them over to plunderers, and they plundered them; and He sold them into the
    hands of their enemies around <i class="calibre12">them,</i> so that they could no longer stand <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1136-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1136-2">f</a></sup></small>against their enemies.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Wherever they went, the hand of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was against them for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1136-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1136-3">g</a></sup></small>evil, as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had spoken and just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had sworn to them, so that
    they were severely distressed.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> raised up judges <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1137-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1137-1">h</a></sup></small>who saved them from the hands of
    those who plundered them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1137-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1137-2">i</a></sup></small>committed infidelity with other gods and bowed down
    to them. They turned aside quickly from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; they did not do the same <i class="calibre12">as their fathers.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And when the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> raised up
    judges for them, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was with the judge and saved them from the hand of their
    enemies all the days of the judge; for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was moved to pity by their groaning
    because of those who tormented and oppressed them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But it came about, when the judge died, that they would
    turn back and act more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them and bow down to them;
    they did not abandon their practices or their obstinate ways.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So the anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    burned against Israel, and He said, &ldquo;Because this nation has violated My covenant which I commanded their
    fathers,
    and has not listened to My voice,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>I in turn will no longer drive out from them any of the
    nations which Joshua left when he died,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>in order to test Israel by them, whether they will keep
    the way of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to walk in it as their fathers <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1137-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1137-3">j</a></sup></small>did, or not.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> allowed those
    nations to remain, not driving them out quickly; and He did not hand them over to Joshua.
