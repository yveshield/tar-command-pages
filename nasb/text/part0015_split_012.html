    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> When the prophets, Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
    Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, who was over them,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the son
    of Jozadak rose up and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and the prophets of God were with
    them, supporting them.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> At that time
    Tattenai, the governor of <i class="calibre12">the province</i> beyond the <i class="calibre12">Euphrates</i> River,
    and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues came to them and spoke to them as follows: &ldquo;Who issued you a decree
    to
    rebuild this <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2141-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then we told them accordingly what the names of the men
    were who were reconstructing this building.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>But the eye of their God was on the elders of the Jews,
    and they did not stop them until the report could reach Darius, and then the decree concerning it could be sent
    back.

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> <i class="calibre12">This is</i> the copy of the letter that
    Tattenai, the governor of <i class="calibre12">the province</i> beyond the <i class="calibre12">Euphrates</i> River,
    and Shethar-bozenai and his colleagues the officials, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>They sent the report to him in which it was written as
    follows: &ldquo;To Darius the king, all peace.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>May it be known to the king that we have gone to the
    province of Judah, to the house of the great God which is being built with large stones, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2142-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_017.html#f2142-1">b</a></sup></small>beams are being laid in the walls; and this work is
    being performed with great care and is succeeding in their hands.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then we asked those elders and said to them as follows:
    &lsquo;Who issued you a decree to rebuild this temple and to finish this structure?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>We also asked them their names so as to inform you, in
    order that we might write down the names of the men who were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2142-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_017.html#f2142-2">c</a></sup></small>in charge.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2142-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_017.html#f2142-3">d</a></sup></small>answered us as
    follows, saying, &lsquo;We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are rebuilding the temple that was
    built
    many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But because our fathers provoked the God of heaven to
    wrath, He handed them over to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, <i class="calibre12">who</i> destroyed
    this temple and deported the people to Babylon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>However, in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon,
    King Cyrus issued a decree to rebuild this house of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Also the gold and silver utensils of the house of God
    which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem and brought them to the temple of Babylon, King Cyrus
    took them from the temple of Babylon and they were given to one whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he had appointed
    governor.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And he said to him, &ldquo;Take these utensils, go <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> deposit them in the temple in Jerusalem, and have the house of God rebuilt in its
    place.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then that Sheshbazzar came <i class="calibre12">and</i>
    laid the foundations of the house of God in Jerusalem; and from then until now it has been under construction and it
    is not <i class="calibre12">yet</i> completed.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And now, if it pleases the king, let a search be
    conducted in the king&rsquo;s treasure house, which is there in Babylon, as to whether a decree was issued by King
    Cyrus
    to rebuild this house of God in Jerusalem; and let the king send to us his decision concerning this <i
      class="calibre12">matter.</i>&rdquo;
