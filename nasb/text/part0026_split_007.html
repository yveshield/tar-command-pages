  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to
    me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Son of man, you live in the midst of the
    rebellious
    house, who have eyes to see but do not see, ears to hear but do not hear; for they are a rebellious house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So as for you, son of man, prepare for yourself baggage
    for exile and go into exile by day in their sight; that is, go into exile from your place to another place in their
    sight. Perhaps they will <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5243-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5243-1">a</a></sup></small>understand, though they are a rebellious house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Bring your baggage out by day in their sight, as baggage
    for exile. Then you shall go out at evening in their sight, as those who are going into exile.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Dig a hole through the wall in their sight and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5243-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5243-2">b</a></sup></small>go out through it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Load <i class="calibre12">the baggage</i> on <i
      class="calibre12">your</i> shoulder in their sight <i class="calibre12">and</i> carry <i class="calibre12">it</i>
    out in the dark. You shall cover your face so that you cannot see the land, for I have set you as a sign to the
    house of Israel.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then I did so,
    just as I had been commanded. By day I brought out my baggage like the baggage of an exile. Then in the evening I
    dug through the wall with my hands; I went out in the dark <i class="calibre12">and</i> carried <i
      class="calibre12">the baggage</i> on <i class="calibre12">my</i> shoulder in their sight.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> And in the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Say, &lsquo;I am <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>The prince who is among them will load <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>I will also spread My net over him, and he will be
    caught in My net. And I will bring him to Babylon in the land of the Chaldeans; yet he will not see it, though he
    will die there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And I will scatter to every wind all who are around
    him, his helpers and all his troops; and I will draw out a sword after them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So they will know that I am the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Moreover, the
    word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,

    drink
    your water with quivering and anxiety.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then say to the people of the land, &lsquo;This is what
    the
    Lord G<span class="small1">OD</span> says concerning the inhabitants of Jerusalem in the land of Israel: &ldquo;They
    will
    eat their bread with anxiety and drink their water with horror, because <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>The inhabited cities will be in ruins, and the land
    will be a desolation. So you will know that I am the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>&ldquo;Son of man, what is this proverb you <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Therefore say to them, &lsquo;This is what the Lord
    G<span class="small1">OD</span> says: &ldquo;I will put an end to this proverb so that they will no longer use it as
    a
    proverb
    in Israel.&rdquo; But tell them, &ldquo;The days are approaching as well as the <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>For I the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will speak

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Furthermore,
    the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Therefore say to them, &lsquo;This is what the Lord
