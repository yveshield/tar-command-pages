  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Passover Held Again</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Josiah celebrated the Passover to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> in Jerusalem, and they slaughtered the Passover <i class="calibre12">animals</i> on the
    fourteenth <i class="calibre12">day</i> of the first month.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged
    them in the service of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>He also said to the Levites who taught all Israel <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> who were holy to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, &ldquo;Put the holy ark in the
    house
    which Solomon the son of David king of Israel built; it will not be a burden on <i class="calibre12">your</i>
    shoulders. Now serve the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God and His people Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Prepare <i class="calibre12">yourselves</i> by your
    fathers&rsquo; households in your divisions, according to the writing of David king of Israel and according to the
    writing
    of his son Solomon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Furthermore, stand in the holy place according to the
    sections of the fathers&rsquo; households of your countrymen, the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2111-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2111-1">a</a></sup></small>lay people,
    and according to the Levites, by division of a father&rsquo;s household.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now slaughter the Passover <i
      class="calibre12">animals,</i> keep one another consecrated, and prepare for your countrymen to act in accordance
    with the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by Moses.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Josiah
    contributed to the lay people, to all who were present, flocks of lambs and young goats, all for the Passover
    offerings, numbering thirty thousand, plus three thousand bulls; these were from the king&rsquo;s property.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>His officers also contributed a <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2112-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2112-1">b</a></sup></small>voluntary offering to the people, the priests, and
    the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials of the house of God, gave the priests 2,600 <i
      class="calibre12">from the flocks</i> and three hundred bulls, for the Passover offerings.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Conaniah also, and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel,
    and Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, the officers of the Levites, contributed five thousand <i
      class="calibre12">from the flocks</i> and five hundred bulls to the Levites for the Passover offerings.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So the
    service was prepared, and the priests stood at their positions and the Levites by their divisions according to the
    king&rsquo;s command.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2113-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2113-1">c</a></sup></small>They
    slaughtered the Passover <i class="calibre12">animals,</i> and while the priests <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2113-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2113-2">d</a></sup></small>sprinkled the blood <i
      class="calibre12">received</i> from their hand, the Levites skinned <i class="calibre12">the animals.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then they removed the burnt offerings so that <i
      class="calibre12">they</i> might give them to the sections of the fathers&rsquo; households of the lay people to
    present
    to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, as it is written in the Book of Moses. <i class="calibre12">They did</i>
    this with the bulls as well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So they roasted the Passover <i
      class="calibre12">animals</i> on the fire according to the ordinance, and they boiled the holy things in pots, in
    kettles, and in pans and carried <i class="calibre12">them</i> quickly to all the lay people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Afterward they prepared for themselves and for the
    priests, because the priests, the sons of Aaron, <i class="calibre12">were</i> offering the burnt offerings and the
    fat until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests, the sons of Aaron.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>The singers, the sons of Asaph, <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> also at their positions according to the command of David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun
    the king&rsquo;s seer; and the gatekeepers at each gate did not have to leave their service, because their kinsmen
    the
    Levites prepared for them.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> So all the
    service of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was prepared on that day to celebrate the Passover, and to offer
    burnt offerings on the altar of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> according to the command of King Josiah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And the sons of Israel who were present celebrated the
    Passover at that time, and the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>There had not been a Passover celebrated like it in
    Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated such a Passover as Josiah
    did with the priests, the Levites, all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>In the eighteenth year of Josiah&rsquo;s reign this
    Passover
    was celebrated.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Josiah Dies in Battle</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> After all this, when Josiah had set the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2114-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2114-1">e</a></sup></small>temple in order, Neco king of Egypt came up to wage
    war at Carchemish on the Euphrates, and Josiah went out to engage him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2114-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2114-2">f</a></sup></small>Neco sent
    messengers to him, saying, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2114-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2114-3">g</a></sup></small>What business do you have with
    me, King of Judah? <i class="calibre12">I am</i> not <i class="calibre12">coming</i> against you today, but against
    the house with which
    I am at war, and God has told me to hurry. For your own sake, stop <i class="calibre12">interfering with</i> God who
    is with me, so that He does not destroy you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>However, Josiah would not turn <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2114-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2114-4">h</a></sup></small>away from him, but disguised himself in order to
    fight against him; nor did he listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but he came to wage war on the
    plain of Megiddo.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>The archers shot King Josiah, and the king said to his
    servants, &ldquo;Take me away, for I am badly wounded.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried
    him on the second chariot which he had, and brought him to Jerusalem <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2114-5" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2114-5">i</a></sup></small>where he died
    and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then Jeremiah chanted a song of mourning for Josiah.
    And all the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their songs of mourning to this day. And they made them an
    ordinance in Israel; behold, they are also written in the Lamentations.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Now the rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of
    devotion as written in the Law of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>and his acts, the first to the last, behold, they are
    written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
