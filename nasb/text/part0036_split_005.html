    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Therefore, when we could no longer endure <i
      class="calibre12">it,</i> we thought it best to be left behind, alone at Athens,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and we sent Timothy, our brother and God&rsquo;s fellow
    worker
    in the gospel of Christ, to strengthen and encourage you for the benefit of your faith,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>so that no one would be <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0036_split_007.html#f7104-1">a</a></sup></small>disturbed by these afflictions. For you yourselves
    know that we have been destined for this.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For even when we were with you, we <i
      class="calibre12">kept</i> telling you in advance that we were going to suffer affliction; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7104-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_007.html#f7104-2">b</a></sup></small>and so it happened, <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0036_split_007.html#f7104-3">c</a></sup></small>as you know.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For this reason, when I could no longer endure <i
      class="calibre12">it,</i> I also sent to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7104-4"

    fear that the tempter might have tempted you, and our labor would be for nothing.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> But now that
    Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us good news of your faith and love, and that you always think
    kindly of us, longing to see us just as we also <i class="calibre12">long to see</i> you,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>for this reason, brothers <i class="calibre12">and
      sisters,</i> in all our distress and affliction we were comforted about you through your faith;

    stand firm in the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For what thanks can we give to God for you in return for
    all the joy with which we rejoice because of you before our God,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>as we keep praying most earnestly night and day that we
    may see your faces, and may complete what is lacking in your faith?
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now may our
    God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you;

    love for one another, and for all people, just as we also <i class="calibre12">do</i> for you;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>so that He may establish your hearts blameless in
    holiness before our God and Father at the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7105-1"
