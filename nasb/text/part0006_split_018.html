  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Death of Miriam</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to the
    wilderness of Zin in the first month; and the people stayed at Kadesh. Now Miriam died there and was buried there.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> There was no
    water for the congregation, and they assembled against Moses and Aaron.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the people argued with Moses and spoke, saying,
    &ldquo;If
    only we had perished when our brothers perished before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Why then have you brought the L<span

    livestock to
    die <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source729-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Why did you make us come up from Egypt, to bring us into
    this wretched place? It is not a place of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source729-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f729-2">b</a></sup></small>grain or figs or vines or
    pomegranates, nor is there water to drink!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then Moses and Aaron came in from the presence of the
    assembly to the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. And the glory of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> appeared to them;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to
    Moses, saying,

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Waters of Meribah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>&ldquo;Take the staff; and you and your brother Aaron
    assemble
    the congregation and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it shall yield its water. So you shall bring water
    for them out of the rock, and have the congregation and their livestock drink.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> So Moses took
    the staff from before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, just as He had commanded him;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>and Moses and Aaron summoned the assembly in front of
    the rock. And he said to them, &ldquo;Listen now, you rebels; shall we bring water for you out of this rock?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice
    with his staff; and water came out abundantly, and the congregation and their livestock drank.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses
    and Aaron, &ldquo;Since you did not trust in Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, for that
    reason
    you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Those <i class="calibre12">were called</i> the waters
    of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source730-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> From Kadesh
    Moses then sent messengers to the king of Edom <i class="calibre12">to say,</i> &ldquo;This is what your brother
    Israel
    has said: &lsquo;You know all the hardship that has <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source731-1"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>that our fathers went down to Egypt, and we stayed in
    Egypt a long time, and the Egyptians treated us and our fathers badly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But when we cried out to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, He heard our voice and sent an angel, and brought us out from Egypt; now behold, we are
    at Kadesh, a town on the edge of your territory.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass
    through field or vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king&rsquo;s road, not
    turning
    to the right or left, until we pass through your territory.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Edom,
    however, said to him, &ldquo;You shall not pass through <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source732-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f732-1">f</a></sup></small>us, or I will
    come out with the
    sword against you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Again, the sons of Israel said to him, &ldquo;We will
    go up
    by the road, and if I and my livestock do drink any of your water, then I will <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source732-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f732-2">g</a></sup></small>pay its price. Let me only pass through on my feet,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source732-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f732-3">h</a></sup></small>nothing <i class="calibre12">more.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But he said, &ldquo;You shall not pass through.&rdquo;
    And
    Edom
    came out against him with a heavy <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source732-4"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f732-4">i</a></sup></small>force and a strong hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through his
    territory; then Israel turned away from him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Now when they
    set out from Kadesh, the sons of Israel, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Death of Aaron</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to
    Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor by the border of the land of Edom, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>&ldquo;Aaron will be gathered to his people; for he
    shall not
    enter the land which I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against My <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Take Aaron and his son Eleazar, and bring them up to
    Mount Hor.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then strip Aaron of his garments and put them on his
    son Eleazar. So Aaron will be gathered <i class="calibre12">to his people</i> and will die there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So Moses did just as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded, and they went up to Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>And after Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put
    them on his son Eleazar, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, the
    whole house of Israel wept for Aaron for thirty days.
