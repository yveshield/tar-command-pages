    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now on that very occasion there were some present who reported

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And Jesus responded and said to them, &ldquo;Do you
    think that
    these Galileans were <i class="calibre12">worse</i> sinners than all the <i class="calibre12">other</i> Galileans <i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And He <i
      class="calibre12">began</i> telling this parable: &ldquo;A man had a fig tree which had been planted in his
    vineyard;
    and he came looking for fruit on it and did not find <i class="calibre12">any.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And he said to the vineyard-keeper, &lsquo;Look! For

    finding any. Cut it down! Why does it even use up the ground?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But he answered and said to him, &lsquo;Sir, leave it
    alone
    for this year too, until I dig around it and put in fertilizer;

    up straight again, and <i class="calibre12">began</i> glorifying God.

    healed on the Sabbath, <i class="calibre12">began</i> saying to the crowd in response, &ldquo;There are six days
    during
    which work should be done; so come during them and get healed, and not on the Sabbath day.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But the Lord answered him and said, &ldquo;You
    hypocrites,
