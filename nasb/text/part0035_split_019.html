    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> For it is superfluous for me to write to you about this
    ministry to the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6990-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6990-1">a</a></sup></small>saints;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>for I know your willingness, of which I boast about you
    to the Macedonians, <i class="calibre12">namely,</i> that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal
    has stirred up most of them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But I have sent the brothers, in order that our boasting
    about you may not prove empty in this case, so that, as I was saying, you will be prepared;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>otherwise, if <i class="calibre12">any</i> Macedonians
    come with me and find you unprepared, we—not to mention you—would be put to shame by this confidence.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So I considered it necessary to urge the brothers that
    they go on ahead to you and arrange in advance your previously promised <small class="small1"><sup

      grudgingly given due to</i> greediness.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now <i
      class="calibre12">I say</i> this: the one who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the one who sows <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Each one <i class="calibre12">must do</i> just as he has

    that, always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed;
