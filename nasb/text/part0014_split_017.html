  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Shekinah Glory</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now when Solomon had finished praying, fire came down from
    heaven and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    filled the house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the priests could not enter the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> because the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> filled the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>All the sons of Israel, seeing the fire come down and
    the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> upon the house, bowed down on the pavement with their faces to the
    ground, and they worshiped and gave praise to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, <i class="calibre12">saying,</i>
    &ldquo;Certainly He is good, certainly His faithfulness is everlasting.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Sacrifices Offered</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Then the king and all the people offered sacrifice before the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>King Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty-two thousand
    oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>The priests stood at their posts, and the Levites also,
    with the musical instruments for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, which King David had made for giving praise
    to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>—&ldquo;for His faithfulness is everlasting&rdquo;—whenever David gave praise
    through
    their <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1994-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f1994-1">a</a></sup></small>ministry; the priests on the other side blew
    trumpets and all Israel was standing.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then Solomon
    consecrated the middle of the courtyard that <i class="calibre12">was</i> before the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, for he offered the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings there, because
    the bronze altar which Solomon had made was not able to contain the burnt offering, the grain offering, and the fat.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Feast of Dedication</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> So Solomon held the feast at that time for seven days, and all
    Israel with him, a very great assembly <i class="calibre12">that came</i> from the entrance of Hamath to the brook
    of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly,
    because they held the dedication of the altar for seven days, and the feast for seven days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month he
    sent the people to their tents, rejoicing and happy in heart because of the goodness that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had shown to David, to Solomon, and to His people Israel.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">God&rsquo;s Promise and Warning</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> So Solomon finished the house of the L<span

    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> appeared to Solomon at night and said to him, &ldquo;I have heard your prayer and

    chosen this place for Myself as a house of sacrifice.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>As for you, if you walk before Me as your father David
    walked, to do according to everything that I have commanded you, and keep My statutes and My ordinances,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>then I will establish your royal throne as I covenanted
    with your father David, saying, &lsquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1996-4"

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> &ldquo;But if
    you
    turn away and abandon My statutes and My commandments which I have set before you, and go and serve other gods and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>As for this house, which was exalted, everyone who
    passes by it will be astonished and say, &lsquo;Why has the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> done these things to

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And they will say, &lsquo;Because they abandoned the

    adopted
    other gods, and worshiped and served them; therefore He has brought all this adversity on them.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
