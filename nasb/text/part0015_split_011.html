  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now when the enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
    people of the exile were building a temple to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of
    fathers&rsquo; <i class="calibre12">households,</i> and said to them, &ldquo;Let us build with you, for like you, we
    seek your God;
    and we
    have been sacrificing to Him since the days of Esarhaddon king of Assyria, who brought us up here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>and bribed advisers against them to frustrate their

    an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>this is a copy of the letter which they sent to him:

    from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are rebuilding the rebellious and evil city and are finishing the walls
    and repairing the foundations.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Now let it be known to the king, that if that city is
    rebuilt and the walls are finished, they will not pay tribute, custom tax, or toll, and it will <small

    fitting for us to see the king&rsquo;s shame, for this reason we have sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and
    informed the
    king,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>so that a search may be conducted in the record books
    of your fathers. And you will discover in the record books and learn that that city is a rebellious city and
    detrimental to kings and provinces, and that they have revolted within it in past days; for this reason that city
    was laid waste.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>We are informing the king that if that city is rebuilt
    and the walls finished, then as a result of this you will have no possession in <i class="calibre12">the

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> <i class="calibre12">Then</i> the king sent a response to

    has been discovered that that city has risen up against the kings in past days, and that rebellion and revolt have

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Now issue a decree to make those men stop <i
      class="calibre12">work,</i> so that this city will not be rebuilt until a decree is issued by me.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Then as soon
    as the copy of King Artaxerxes&rsquo; decree was read before Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their colleagues,
    they went
    in a hurry to Jerusalem to the Jews and stopped them by military force.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Then work on
    the house of God in Jerusalem was discontinued, and it was stopped until the second year of the reign of Darius king
    of Persia.
