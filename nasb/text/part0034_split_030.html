    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> This is the way <i class="calibre12">any</i> person is to
    regard us: as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>In this case, moreover, it is required <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6902-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6902-1">a</a></sup></small>of stewards that one be found trustworthy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But to me it is an insignificant matter that I would be
    examined by you, or by <i class="calibre12">any</i> human <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6902-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_010.html#f6902-2">b</a></sup></small>court; in
    fact, I do not even examine myself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For I am not aware of anything against myself; however I
    am not vindicated by this, but the one who examines me is the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Therefore do not go on <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6902-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6902-3">c</a></sup></small>passing judgment before <small class="small1"><sup

      class="calibre12">but wait</i> until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the things hidden in the
    darkness and disclose the motives of <i class="calibre12">human</i> hearts; and then praise will come to each person
    from God.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now these
    things, brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos on your
    account, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that no one of you will become <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>For who considers you as superior? What do you have that
    you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> You are
    already filled, you have already become rich, you have become kings without us; and indeed, <i
      class="calibre12">I</i> wish that you had become kings so that we also might reign with you!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For I think, God has exhibited us, the apostles, last of
    all as men condemned to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to mankind.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>We are fools on account of Christ, but you are prudent
    in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are without honor!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Up to this present hour we are both hungry and thirsty,
    and are poorly clothed and roughly treated and homeless;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>and we labor, working with our own hands; when we are
    verbally abused, we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure <i class="calibre12">it;</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>when we are slandered, we <small class="small1"><sup

    world, the dregs of all things, <i class="calibre12">even</i> until now.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> I do not
    write these things to shame you, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For if you were to have countless tutors in Christ, yet
    <i class="calibre12">you would</i> not <i class="calibre12">have</i> many fathers, for in Christ Jesus I became your
    father through the gospel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Therefore I urge you, be imitators of me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my
    beloved and faithful child in the Lord, and he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach
    everywhere in every church.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I
    shall find out, not the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6905-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For the kingdom of God is not in <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>What do you desire? That I come to you with a rod, or
    with love and a spirit of gentleness?
