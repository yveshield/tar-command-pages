    prophet sent from Jerusalem to the rest of the elders of the exile, the priests, the prophets, and all the people
    whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>(<i class="calibre12">This was</i> after King Jeconiah

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Now you shall
