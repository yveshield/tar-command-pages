    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then Moses

    Moses, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> And the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses, &ldquo;When you go <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    not let the people go.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then you shall say to Pharaoh, &lsquo;This is what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;Israel is My son, My firstborn.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So Zipporah took a flint and cut off her son&rsquo;s

          href="part0005_split_000.html#f279-2">r</a></sup></small>threw it at Moses&rsquo; feet; and she said,
    &ldquo;You are
    indeed a groom of blood to me!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>So He left him alone. At that time she said, &ldquo;<i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> Now the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Aaron, &ldquo;Go to meet Moses in the wilderness.&rdquo; So he went and met
    him
    at the
    mountain of God and kissed him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Moses told Aaron all the words of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Then Moses and Aaron went and assembled all the elders

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>and Aaron spoke all the words which the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>So the people believed; and when they heard that the
