    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But when the vine-growers saw him, they discussed with
    one another, saying, &lsquo;This is the heir; let&rsquo;s kill him so that the inheritance will be ours.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">so</i> they threw him out of
