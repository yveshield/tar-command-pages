            all the
            guests of Adonijah trembled and got up, and each went on his way.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>Adonijah also was afraid of Solomon, and he got
            up, and
            went, and took hold of the horns of the altar.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>Now it was reported to Solomon, saying,
            &ldquo;Behold,
            Adonijah is afraid of King Solomon, for behold, he has taken hold of the horns of the altar, saying,
            &lsquo;May King
            Solomon swear to me today that he will not put his servant to death with the sword.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">52</sup></small>And Solomon said, &ldquo;If he is a worthy man,

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>So King Solomon sent <i

            they brought him down from the altar. And he came and prostrated himself before King Solomon, and Solomon
            said to
            him, &ldquo;Go to your house.&rdquo;
