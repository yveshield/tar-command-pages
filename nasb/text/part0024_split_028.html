  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army, with all the kingdoms of the
    earth that were <i class="calibre12">under</i> his <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4989-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0025_split_016.html#f4989-1">a</a></sup></small>control and all the peoples,
    were fighting against Jerusalem and all its cities, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the
    God of Israel says: &lsquo;Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah and say to him, &ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Behold, I am handing this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will
    burn it
    with fire.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And as for you, you will not escape from his hand, for
    you will assuredly be caught and handed over to him; and you will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, and he will
    speak with you <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4989-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4989-2">b</a></sup></small>face to face, and you will go to
    Babylon.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Yet hear the word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, Zedekiah king of Judah! This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says
    concerning you: &lsquo;You will not die by the sword.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>You will die in peace; and as <i
      class="calibre12">spices</i> were burned for your fathers, the former kings who were before you, so they will burn
    <i class="calibre12">spices</i> for you; and they will mourn for you, <i class="calibre12">crying,</i> &ldquo;Oh, <i
      class="calibre12">my</i> lord!&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo; For I have spoken the word,&rdquo; declares the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then Jeremiah
    the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>when the army of the king of Babylon was fighting
    against Jerusalem and all the remaining cities of Judah, <i class="calibre12">that is,</i> Lachish and Azekah, for
    they <i class="calibre12">alone</i> remained as fortified cities among the cities of Judah.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> The word that
    came to Jeremiah from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> after King Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the
    people who were in Jerusalem, to proclaim <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4990-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0025_split_016.html#f4990-1">c</a></sup></small>release to them:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>that each person was to set his male servant free and
    each his female servant, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, so that no one would keep them, his Jewish brother <i
      class="calibre12">or sister,</i> in bondage.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And all the officials and all the people obeyed who had
    entered into the covenant that each person was to set his male servant free and each his female servant, so that no
    one would keep them in bondage any longer; they obeyed, and set <i class="calibre12">them free.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But afterward they turned around and took back the male
    servants and the female servants whom they had set free, and brought them into subjection as male servants and as
    female servants.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to Jeremiah from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the
    God of Israel says: &lsquo;I made a covenant with your forefathers on the day that I brought them out of the land of
    Egypt, from the house of bondage, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>&ldquo;At the end of seven years each of you shall set
    free
    his Hebrew brother who <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4991-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4991-1">d</a></sup></small>has been sold to you and has served you for six
    years, and you shall send him out free from you.&rdquo; But your forefathers did not obey Me nor incline their ear
    to Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Although recently you <i class="calibre12">had</i>
    turned and done what is right in My sight, each one proclaiming <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    neighbor, and you had made a covenant before Me in the house which is called by My name.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Yet you turned and profaned My name, and each person
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4991-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4991-3">f</a></sup></small>took back his male servant and each his female
    servant whom you had set free according to their desire, and you brought them into subjection to be your male and
    female servants.&rsquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span>
    &ldquo;Therefore
    this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;You have not obeyed Me in proclaiming <small

    terror to
    all the kingdoms of the earth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>I will give the people who have violated My covenant,
    who have not fulfilled the words of the covenant which they made before Me, <i class="calibre12">when</i> they cut
    the calf in two and passed between its parts—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>the officials of Judah and the officials of Jerusalem,
    the high officials and the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>I will hand them over to their enemies and to those who
    seek their lives. And their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the earth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials I will also
    hand over to their enemies and to those who seek their lives, and to the army of the king of Babylon which has
    withdrawn from you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Behold, I am going to give a command,&rsquo; declares
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, &lsquo;and I will bring them back to this city, and they will fight against it and
    take
    it and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without inhabitant.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
