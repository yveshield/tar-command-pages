    Jerusalem had decided to celebrate the Passover in the second month,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>since they could not celebrate it at that time, because
    the priests had not consecrated themselves in sufficient numbers, nor had the people been gathered to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So they established a decree to circulate a <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who were

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Now do not stiffen your neck like your fathers, <i

    country of Ephraim and Manasseh, and as far as Zebulun, but they laughed at them with scorn and mocked them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Nevertheless, some men of Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun
    humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>The hand of God was also on Judah to give them one
    heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Passover Reinstituted</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now many people were gathered at Jerusalem to celebrate the
    Feast of Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very large assembly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>They got up and removed the altars which <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> in Jerusalem; they also removed all the incense altars and threw <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> into the brook Kidron.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then they slaughtered the Passover <i
      class="calibre12">lambs</i> on the fourteenth of the second month. And the priests and Levites were ashamed of
    themselves, and consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>They stood at their stations following their custom,
    according to the Law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood <i class="calibre12">which they
      received</i> from the hand of the Levites.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For <i class="calibre12">there were</i> many in the
    assembly who had not consecrated themselves; therefore, the Levites <i class="calibre12">were</i> in charge of the
    slaughter of the Passover <i class="calibre12">lambs</i> for everyone who <i class="calibre12">was</i> unclean, in
    order to consecrate <i class="calibre12">them</i> to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and
    Manasseh, <i class="calibre12">and</i> Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, yet they ate the Passover
    contrary to <i class="calibre12">what was</i> written. For Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, &ldquo;May the good
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> pardon
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God of his fathers, though not according to the purification <i
      class="calibre12">rules</i> of the sanctuary.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> heard Hezekiah
    and healed the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>The sons of Israel present in Jerusalem celebrated the
    Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy, and the Levites and the priests were praising the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> day after day with loud instruments to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Hezekiah spoke <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2090-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2090-1">h</a></sup></small>encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good
    insight <i class="calibre12">in the things</i> of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. So they ate for the
    appointed seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of
    their fathers.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Then the
    whole assembly decided to celebrate <i class="calibre12">the feast</i> another seven days, so they celebrated the
    seven days with joy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>For Hezekiah king of Judah had contributed to the
    assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep, and the princes had contributed to the assembly a thousand bulls
    and ten thousand sheep; and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>All the assembly of Judah rejoiced, with the priests
    and the Levites and all the assembly that came from Israel, both the strangers who came from the land of Israel and
    those living in Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, because there was
    nothing like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Then the Levitical priests stood and blessed the
    people; and their voice was heard and their prayer came to His holy dwelling place, to heaven.
