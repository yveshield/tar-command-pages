            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then they came out, they and all their armies

            left to
            them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And Joshua did to them just as the L<span

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then
            Joshua
            turned back at that time and captured Hazor, and struck its king with the sword; for Hazor previously was
            the head
            of all these kingdoms.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>They struck every person who was in it with the

            the sword, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1073-1" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Joshua captured all the cities of these kings,
            and all
            their kings; and he struck them with the edge of the sword <i class="calibre12">and</i> utterly destroyed
            them, just
            as Moses the servant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>However, Israel did not burn any cities that
            stood on
            their mounds, except Hazor alone, <i class="calibre12">which</i> Joshua burned.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And all the spoils of these cities and the
            cattle, the
            sons of Israel took as their plunder; but they struck every person with the edge of the sword, until they
            had
            destroyed them. They left no one breathing.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
            had
            commanded His servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all
            that the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses.

            of Mount Hermon. And
            he captured all their kings, and struck them and put them to death.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Joshua waged war a long time with all these
            kings.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>There was not a city which made peace with the
            sons of
            Israel except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took them all in battle.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For it was of the L<span

            Israel in battle in

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then
            Joshua
            came at that time and eliminated the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, Debir, Anab, and from all
            the hill
            country of Judah and all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>There were no Anakim left in the land of the
            sons of
            Israel; only in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod <i class="calibre12">some</i> remained.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So Joshua took the whole land, in accordance
            with
            everything that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had spoken to Moses; and Joshua gave it as an
            inheritance to
            Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. So the land was at rest from war.
