    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now, brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> we make
    known to you the grace of God which has been given in the churches of Macedonia,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>that in a <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6987-1" epub:type="noteref"

    and their deep poverty overflowed in the wealth of their liberality.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For I testify that according to their ability, and
    beyond their ability, <i class="calibre12">they gave</i> voluntarily,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>begging us with much urging for the favor <small

          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6987-5">e</a></sup></small>expected, but they first gave themselves to the Lord
    and to us by the will of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So we urged Titus that as he had previously made a
    beginning, so he would also complete in you this gracious work as well.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> But just as
    you excel in everything, in faith, speaking, knowledge, and in all earnestness and in the <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>I am not saying <i class="calibre12">this</i> as a
    command, but as proving, through the earnestness of others, the sincerity of your love as well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that
    though He was rich, yet for your sake He became poor, so that you through His poverty might become rich.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>I give <i class="calibre12">my</i> opinion in this
    matter, for this is to your advantage, who were the first to begin a year ago not only to do <i
      class="calibre12">this,</i> but also to desire <i class="calibre12">to do it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But now finish <small class="small1"><sup

    completion of it by your ability.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>For if the willingness is present, it is acceptable
    according to what <i class="calibre12">a person</i> has, not according to what he does not have.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>For <i class="calibre12">this</i> is not for the relief
    of others <i class="calibre12">and</i> for your hardship, but by way of equalityâ€”
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>at this present time your abundance <i
      class="calibre12">will serve as assistance</i> for their need, so that their abundance also may <small

    your need, so that there may be equality;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>as it is written: &ldquo;T<span class="small1">HE ONE

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> But thanks be
    to God who puts the same earnestness in your behalf in the heart of Titus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself
    very earnest, he has gone to you of his own accord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>We have sent along with him the brother whose fame in
    <i class="calibre12">the things of</i> the gospel <i class="calibre12">has spread</i> through all the churches;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>and not only <i class="calibre12">that,</i> but he has
    also been appointed by the churches to travel with us in this gracious work, which is being administered by us for
    the glory of the Lord Himself, and <i class="calibre12">to show</i> our readiness,

    precaution so that no one will discredit us in our administration of this generous gift;

    the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of <i class="calibre12">other</i> people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>We have sent with them our brother, whom we have often
