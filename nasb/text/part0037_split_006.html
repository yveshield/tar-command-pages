    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> What was from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have
    seen with our eyes, what we have looked at and touched with our hands, concerning the Word of Life—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and the life was revealed, and we have seen and testify
    and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>what we have seen and heard we proclaim to you also, so
    that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father, and with His Son Jesus
    Christ.

    Light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin.

    ourselves and the truth is not in us.

    that He will forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

    and His word is not in us.
