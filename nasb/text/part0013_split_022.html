    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of
    Israel fled from the Philistines but fell fatally wounded on Mount Gilboa.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the Philistines also overtook Saul and his sons, and
    the Philistines <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1887-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>The battle became severe against Saul, and the archers
    found him; and he was wounded by the archers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then Saul said to his armor bearer, &ldquo;Draw your
    sword and
    thrust me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised <i class="calibre12">Philistines</i> will come and abuse
    me.&rdquo; But his armor bearer would not, for he was very afraid. So Saul took his <i class="calibre12">own</i>
    sword and
    fell on it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he
    likewise fell on his sword and died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Saul died with his three sons, and all <i
      class="calibre12">those</i> of his house died together.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> When all the
    people of Israel who were in the valley saw that they had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned
    their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and lived in them.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> It came about
    the next day, when the Philistines came to strip those killed, that they found Saul and his sons fallen on Mount
    Gilboa.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So they stripped him and took his head and his armor and
    sent <i class="calibre12">messengers</i> around the land of the Philistines to carry the good news to their idols
    and to the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>They put his armor in the house of their gods and

    Saul and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh; and they buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh,
    and fasted for seven days.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> So Saul died
    for his unfaithfulness which he committed against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, because of the word of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which he did not keep; and also because he asked <i class="calibre12">counsel</i>
    of a medium, making inquiry <i class="calibre12">of her,</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>and did not inquire of the L<span
