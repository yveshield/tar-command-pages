  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Absalom&rsquo;s Conspiracy</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about after this that Absalom provided for himself
    a chariot and horses, and fifty men <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1484-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1484-1">a</a></sup></small>to run ahead of him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And Absalom used to rise early and stand beside the road
    to the gate; and when any man who had a lawsuit was to come before the king for judgment, Absalom would call out to
    him and say, &ldquo;From what city are you?&rdquo; And he would say, &ldquo;Your servant is from one of the tribes
    of
    Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Absalom would say to him, &ldquo;See, your <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1484-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1484-2">b</a></sup></small>claims are good and right, but you have no one to
    listen to you on the part of the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Moreover, Absalom would say, &ldquo;Oh that someone
    would
    appoint me judge in the land, then every man who has a lawsuit or claim could come to me, and I would give him
    justice!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And whenever a man approached to prostrate himself
    before him, he would put out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Absalom dealt this way with all Israel who came to the
    king for judgment; so Absalom stole the hearts of the people of Israel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now it came
    about at the end of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1485-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1485-1">c</a></sup></small>four years that Absalom said to the king,
    &ldquo;Please
    let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, in Hebron.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>For your servant made a vow while I was living in Geshur
    in Aram, saying, &lsquo;If the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will
    serve
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>The king said to him, &ldquo;Go in peace.&rdquo; So he
    got up
    and
    went to Hebron.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But Absalom sent spies throughout the tribes of Israel,
    saying, &ldquo;As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then you shall say, &lsquo;Absalom is king in
    Hebron!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then two hundred men went with Absalom from Jerusalem,
    who were invited and went <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1485-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1485-2">d</a></sup></small>innocently, for they did not know anything.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite,
    David&rsquo;s
    counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering the sacrifices. And the conspiracy was strong, for the people
    continually increased with Absalom.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Flees Jerusalem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then a messenger came to David, saying, &ldquo;The hearts of
    the
    people of Israel are <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1486-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1486-1">e</a></sup></small>with Absalom.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So David said to all his servants who were with him in
    Jerusalem, &ldquo;Arise and let&rsquo;s flee, for <i class="calibre12">otherwise</i> none of us will escape from
    Absalom.
    Go
    quickly, or he will hurry and overtake us, and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the
    sword.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then the king&rsquo;s servants said to the king,
    &ldquo;Behold,
    your servants <i class="calibre12">will do</i> whatever my lord the king chooses.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So the king left, and all his household <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1486-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1486-2">f</a></sup></small>with him; but the king left ten concubines behind to
    take care of the house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>The king left, and all the people <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1486-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1486-3">g</a></sup></small>with him, and they stopped at the last house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now all of his servants passed by beside him, and all
    the Cherethites, all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men who had come <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1486-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1486-4">h</a></sup></small>with him from Gath, passed by before the king.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then the king
    said to Ittai the Gittite, &ldquo;Why should you go with us too? Return and stay with <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1487-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1487-1">i</a></sup></small>your king, since you are a foreigner and an exile as
    well; <i class="calibre12">return</i> to your own place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>You came <i class="calibre12">only</i> yesterday, so
    should I make you wander with us today, while I go wherever I go? Return and take your brothers back; mercy and
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1487-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1487-2">j</a></sup></small>truth be with you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But Ittai answered the king and said, &ldquo;As the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king may be, whether for
    death or for life, there assuredly shall your servant be!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then David said to Ittai, &ldquo;Go and cross over <i
      class="calibre12">the brook Kidron.</i>&rdquo; So Ittai the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1487-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1487-3">k</a></sup></small>little ones who <i class="calibre12">were</i> with
    him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>While all the country was weeping with a loud voice,
    all the people were crossing over. The king was also crossing over the brook Kidron, and all the people were
    crossing over toward the way of the wilderness.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Now behold,
    Zadok also <i class="calibre12">came,</i> and all the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And
    they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar came up until all the people had finished crossing over from the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And the king said to Zadok, &ldquo;Return the ark of
    God to
    the city. If I find favor in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, then He will bring me back and show
    me <i class="calibre12">both</i> it and His habitation.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>But if He says this: &lsquo;I have no delight in
    you,&rsquo;
    <i class="calibre12">then</i> here I am, let Him do to me as seems good <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1488-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1488-1">l</a></sup></small>to Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>The king also said to Zadok the priest, &ldquo;Are you
    <i class="calibre12">not</i> a seer? Return to the city in peace, and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and
    Jonathan the son of Abiathar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>See, I am going to wait at the river crossing places of
    the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to
    Jerusalem and remained there.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> And David was
    going up the ascent of the <i class="calibre12">Mount of</i> Olives, weeping as he went, and his head was covered,
    and he was walking barefoot. Then all the people who were with him each covered his own head, and they were going
    up, weeping as they went.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Now <i class="calibre12">someone</i> informed David,
    saying, &ldquo;Ahithophel is among the conspirators with Absalom.&rdquo; And David said, &ldquo;L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>,
    please make the advice of Ahithophel foolish.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">32</b></span> It happened
    as David was coming to the summit, where God was worshiped, that behold, Hushai the Archite met him with his <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1489-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1489-1">m</a></sup></small>coat torn, and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1489-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1489-2">n</a></sup></small>dust on his head.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>And David said to him, &ldquo;If you go over with me,
    then
    you will become a burden to me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>But if you return to the city and say to Absalom,
    &lsquo;I
    will be your servant, O king; even <i class="calibre12">as</i> I was your father&rsquo;s servant in time past, so
    now I
    will also be your servant,&rsquo; then you can foil the advice of Ahithophel for me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Are Zadok and Abiathar the priests not with you there?
    So it shall be that whatever you hear from the king&rsquo;s house, you shall report to Zadok and Abiathar the
    priests.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Behold their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz,
    Zadok&rsquo;s <i class="calibre12">son</i> and Jonathan, Abiathar&rsquo;s <i class="calibre12">son;</i> and by them
    you shall
    send me everything that you hear.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>So Hushai, David&rsquo;s friend, came into the city,
    and
    Absalom came into Jerusalem.
