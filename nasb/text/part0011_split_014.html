  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Sheba&rsquo;s Revolt</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now a worthless man happened to be there whose name was Sheba,
    the son of Bichri, a Benjaminite; and he blew the trumpet and said,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;We have no share in David, </div>
  <div class="block">Nor do we have an inheritance in the son of Jesse; </div>
  <div class="block">Every man to his tents, Israel!&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So all the men of Israel <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1515-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1515-1">a</a></sup></small>withdrew from following David <i

          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1515-2">b</a></sup></small>remained loyal to their king, from the Jordan even
    to Jerusalem.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Then David
    came to his house in Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, the concubines whom he had left behind to take care
    of the house, and put them in custody and provided them with food, but did not <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1516-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1516-1">c</a></sup></small>have relations with them. So they were locked up
    until the day of their death, living as widows.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Now the king
    said to Amasa, &ldquo;Summon the men of Judah for me <i class="calibre12">within</i> three days, and be present here
    yourself.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So Amasa went to summon <i class="calibre12">the men
      of</i> Judah, but he was delayed longer than the set time which he had designated for him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And David said to Abishai, &ldquo;Now Sheba the son of
    Bichri
    will do us more harm than Absalom; take your lord&rsquo;s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find for
    himself
    fortified cities and escape from our sight.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So Joab&rsquo;s men went out after him, along with the
    Cherethites, the Pelethites, and all the warriors; and they left Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When they were at the large stone which is in Gibeon,
    Amasa came <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1517-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1517-1">d</a></sup></small>to meet them. Now Joab was dressed in his military
    attire, and over it <i class="calibre12">he had</i> a belt with a sword in its sheath strapped on at his waist; and
    as he went forward, it fell out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And Joab said to Amasa, &ldquo;Is it going well for you,
    my
    brother?&rdquo; And Joab took hold of Amasa by the beard with his right hand to kiss him.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Amasa Murdered</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But Amasa was not on guard against the sword which was
    in Joab&rsquo;s hand, so he struck him in the belly with it and spilled out his intestines on the ground, and did
    not <i class="calibre12">strike</i> him again, and he died. Then Joab and his brother Abishai pursued Sheba the son
    of
    Bichri.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Now one of Joab&rsquo;s young men stood by him and
    said,
    &ldquo;Whoever favors Joab and whoever is for David, follow Joab!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But Amasa was wallowing in <i class="calibre12">his
      own</i> blood in the middle of the road. And when the man saw that all the people stood still, he removed Amasa
    from the road to the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by him stood still.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Revolt Put Down</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>As soon as he was removed from the road, all the men
    went on after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Now he went
    on through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, that is, Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they assembled and went
    after him as well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And they came and besieged him in Abel Beth-maacah, and
    they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1518-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1518-1">e</a></sup></small>built up an assault ramp against the city, and it
    stood against the outer rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction in order to topple
    the wall.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then a wise woman called out from the city,
    &ldquo;Listen,
    listen! Please tell Joab, &lsquo;Come here that I may speak with you.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So he approached her, and the woman said, &ldquo;Are
    you
    Joab?&rdquo; And he answered, &ldquo;I am.&rdquo; Then she said to him, &ldquo;Listen to the words of your
    slave.&rdquo; And he said,
    &ldquo;I am
    listening.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then she spoke, saying, &ldquo;In the past they used to
    say,
    &lsquo;They will undoubtedly ask <i class="calibre12">advice</i> at Abel,&rsquo; and that is how they ended <i
      class="calibre12">a dispute.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>I <i class="calibre12">am one</i> of those who are
    ready for peace <i class="calibre12">and</i> faithful in Israel. You are trying to destroy a city, even a mother in
    Israel. Why would you swallow up the inheritance of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Joab replied, &ldquo;Far be it, far be it from me that
    I
    would consume or destroy!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Such is not the case. But a man from the hill country
    of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has raised his hand against King David. Only turn him over, and I will
    depart from the city.&rdquo; And the woman said to Joab, &ldquo;Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the
    wall.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then the woman wisely came to all the people. And they
    cut off the head of Sheba the son of Bichri and threw it to Joab. So he blew the trumpet, and they were dispersed
    from the city, each to his tent. Joab also returned to the king at Jerusalem.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now Joab was
    <i class="calibre12">in command</i> of the entire army of Israel, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the
    Cherethites and the Pelethites;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>and Adoram was over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat
    the son of Ahilud was the secretary;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>and Sheva was scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar were
    priests;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Ira the Jairite also was a priest to David.
