            Ammonites died,
            and his son Hanun became king in his place.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then David said, &ldquo;I will show kindness to
            Hanun the son
            of Nahash, just as his father showed kindness to me.&rdquo; So David sent <small class="small1"><sup

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>the commanders of the Ammonites said to their

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Hanun took David&rsquo;s servants and shaved
            off

            informed David,
            he sent <i class="calibre12">servants</i> to meet them, because the men were extremely humiliated. And the
            king
            said, &ldquo;Stay in Jericho until your beards grow <i class="calibre12">back,</i> and <i
                  class="calibre12">then</i> you

            when the

            Abishai, and he
            lined <i class="calibre12">them</i> up against the sons of Ammon.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;If the Arameans are too
            strong for me,
            then you shall help me; but if the sons of Ammon are too strong for you, then I will come to help you.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Be strong, and let&rsquo;s show ourselves
            courageous
            for the

            in His
            sight.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So Joab and the people who were with him
            advanced to
            the battle against the Arameans, and they fled from him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When the sons of Ammon saw that the Arameans
            had fled,
            they <i class="calibre12">also</i> fled from Abishai and entered the city. Then Joab returned from <i

            assembled together.

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Now when it was reported to David, he gathered
            all
            Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. And the Arameans lined up against David and
            fought him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But the Arameans fled from Israel, and David
            killed
            seven hundred charioteers of the Arameans and forty thousand horsemen, and struck Shobach the commander of
            their
            army, and he died there.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>When all the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw

            peace with Israel and
            served them. So the Arameans were afraid to help the sons of Ammon anymore.
