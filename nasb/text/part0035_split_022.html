    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>I know a man in Christ, who fourteen years ago—whether
    in the body I do not know, or out of the body I do not know, God knows—such a man was caught up to the third heaven.

    from the body I do not know, God knows—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>was caught up into Paradise and heard inexpressible
    words, which a man is not permitted to speak.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>In behalf of such a man I will boast; but in my own
    behalf I will not boast, except regarding <i class="calibre12">my</i> weaknesses.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For if I do wish to boast I will not be foolish, for I
    will be speaking the truth; but I refrain <i class="calibre12">from this,</i> so that no one will credit me with
    more than he sees <i class="calibre12">in</i> me or hears from me.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Because of the extraordinary <i

    keep me from exalting myself!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that
    it might leave me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And He has said to me, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for
    you,

    difficulties, in behalf of Christ; for when I am weak, then I am strong.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> I have become
    foolish; you yourselves compelled me. Actually I should have been commended by you, since I was in no respect

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>For in what respect were you treated as inferior to the

    third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not be a burden to you; for I do not seek what is yours, but you;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>I will most gladly spend and be expended for your
    souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?

    sent the brother with him. Titus did not take any advantage of you, did he? Did we not <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For I am afraid that perhaps when I come I may find you
    to be not what I wish, and may be found by you to be not what you wish; that perhaps <i class="calibre12">there will
      be</i> strife, jealousy, angry tempers, selfishness, slanders, gossip, arrogance, disturbances;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small><i class="calibre12">I am afraid</i> that when I come
    again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over many of those who have sinned in the past and not
    repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and indecent behavior which they have practiced.
