  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Baskets of Figs and the Returnees</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken into exile
    Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the officials of Judah with the craftsmen and metalworkers from
    Jerusalem and had brought them to Babylon, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> showed me: behold, two baskets of
    figs placed before the temple of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>One basket had very good figs, like first-ripe figs, and
    the other basket had very bad figs which could not be eaten due to rottenness.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me,
    &ldquo;What do you see, Jeremiah?&rdquo; And I said, &ldquo;Figs: the good figs <i class="calibre12">are</i> very
    good,
    and the bad <i class="calibre12">ones,</i> very bad, which cannot be eaten due to rottenness.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the
    God of Israel says: &lsquo;Like these good figs, so I will regard as good the captives of Judah, whom I have sent
    out of
    this place <i class="calibre12">into</i> the land of the Chaldeans.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For I will set My eyes on them for good, and I will
    bring them back to this land; and I will build them up and not overthrow them, and I will plant them and not uproot
    them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>I will also give them a heart to know Me, for I am the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and they will be My people, and I will be their God, for they will return to Me
    wholeheartedly.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> &lsquo;But
    like the
    bad figs which cannot be eaten due to rottenness,&rsquo; indeed, this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    says,
    &lsquo;so will I give up Zedekiah king of Judah and his officials, and the remnant of Jerusalem who remain in this
    land,
    and the ones who live in the land of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>I will make them an object of terror <i
      class="calibre12">and an</i> evil for all the kingdoms of the earth, as a disgrace and a proverb, a taunt and a
    curse in all the places where I will scatter them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And I will send the sword, the famine, and the plague
    upon them until they are eliminated from the land which I gave to them and their forefathers.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
