  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Prophetic Call to Samuel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> before Eli. And word from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was rare in those days;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1278-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1278-1">a</a></sup></small>visions were infrequent.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> But it
    happened at that time as Eli was lying down in his place (now his eyesight had begun to be <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1279-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1279-1">b</a></sup></small>poor <i class="calibre12">and</i> he could not see
    <i class="calibre12">well),</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was
    lying down in the temple of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> where the ark of God <i class="calibre12">was,</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> called Samuel;
    and he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then he ran to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am, for you
    called
    me.&rdquo; But he said, &ldquo;I did not call, go back <i class="calibre12">and</i> lie down.&rdquo; So he went and
    lay down.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> called yet
    again, &ldquo;Samuel!&rdquo; So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am, for you called me.&rdquo;
    But he said,
    &ldquo;I did not
    call, my son, go back <i class="calibre12">and</i> lie down.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now Samuel did not yet know the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, nor had the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> yet been revealed to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> called Samuel
    again for the third time. And he got up and went to Eli and said, &ldquo;Here I am, for you called me.&rdquo; Then
    Eli
    realized
    that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was calling the boy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And Eli said to Samuel, &ldquo;Go lie down, and it shall
    be if
    He calls you, that you shall say, &lsquo;Speak, L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, for Your servant is
    listening.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came and stood, and called as at <i class="calibre12">the</i> other times:
    &ldquo;Samuel!
    Samuel!&rdquo; And Samuel said, &ldquo;Speak, for Your servant is listening.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
    Samuel, &ldquo;Behold, I am going to do a thing in Israel, <i class="calibre12">and</i> both ears of everyone who
    hears <i class="calibre12">about</i> it will ring.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>On that day I will carry out against Eli everything
    that I have spoken in regard to his house, from beginning to end.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>For I have told him that I am going to judge his house
    forever for the wrongdoing that he knew, because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves and he did not rebuke
    them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the
    wrongdoing of Eli&rsquo;s house shall never be atoned for by sacrifice or offering.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> So Samuel lay
    down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. But Samuel was
    afraid to tell the vision to Eli.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then Eli called Samuel and said, &ldquo;Samuel, my
    son.&rdquo; And
    he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>He said, &ldquo;What is the word that He spoke to you?
    Please
    do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more so, if you hide a <i class="calibre12">single</i> word
    from me of all the words that He spoke to you!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So Samuel told him <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1280-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1280-1">c</a></sup></small>everything and hid nothing from him. And he said,
    &ldquo;He is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; let Him do <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1280-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1280-2">d</a></sup></small>what seems
    good to Him.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Now Samuel
    grew, and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was with him, and He let none of his words <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1281-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1281-1">e</a></sup></small>fail.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that
    Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> appeared again
    at Shiloh, because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> revealed Himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
