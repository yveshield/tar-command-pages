  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but <i
      class="calibre12">rather</i> appeal to <i class="calibre12">him</i> as a father, <i class="calibre12">and to</i>
    the younger men as brothers,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>to the older women as mothers, <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> to the younger women as sisters, in all purity.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Honor widows
    who are actually widows;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>but if any widow has children or grandchildren, they
    must first learn to show proper respect for their own family and to give back compensation to their parents; for
    this is acceptable in the sight of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now she who is actually a widow and has been left alone
    has set her hope on God, and she continues in requests and prayers night and day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But she who indulges herself in luxury is dead, <i
      class="calibre12">even</i> while she lives.

    instructions as well, so that they may be above reproach.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But if anyone does not provide for his own, and
    especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> A widow is to
    be put on the list only if she is not less than sixty years old, <i class="calibre12">having been</i> the wife of
    one man,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>having a reputation for good works; <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> if she has brought up children, if she has shown hospitality to strangers, if she has

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But refuse <i class="calibre12">to register</i> younger
    widows, for when they feel physical desires alienating them from Christ, they want to get married,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small><i class="calibre12">thereby</i> incurring
    condemnation, because they have <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7134-2"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>At the same time they also learn <i
      class="calibre12">to be</i> idle, as they go around from house to house; and not merely idle, but also <i
      class="calibre12">they become</i> gossips and busybodies, talking about things not proper <i class="calibre12">to
      mention.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Therefore, I want younger <i
      class="calibre12">widows</i> to get married, have children, manage their households, <i class="calibre12">and</i>
    give the enemy no opportunity for reproach;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>for some have already turned away to follow Satan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>If any woman who is a believer has <i
      class="calibre12">dependent</i> widows, she must assist them and the church must not be burdened, so that it may
    assist those who are actually widows.
