  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Conquest of Jericho</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Jericho was tightly shut because of the sons of Israel; no
    one went out and no one came in.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Joshua,
    &ldquo;See, I have handed Jericho over to you, with its king <i class="calibre12">and</i> the valiant warriors.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And you shall march around the city, all the men of war
    circling the city once. You shall do so for six days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Also seven priests shall carry seven trumpets of
    rams&rsquo;
    horns in front of the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests
    shall blow the trumpets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>It shall be that when they make a long blast with the
    ram&rsquo;s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the
    wall
    of the city will fall down <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1041-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1041-1">a</a></sup></small>flat, and the people shall go up, everyone <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1041-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1041-2">b</a></sup></small>straight ahead.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> So Joshua the
    son of Nun called the priests and said to them, &ldquo;Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry
    seven
    trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns in front of the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1042-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1042-1">c</a></sup></small>he said to the
    people, &ldquo;Go forward and march around the city, and the armed men shall go on ahead of the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And it was <i class="calibre12">so,</i> that when Joshua
    had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of rams&rsquo; horns before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> went forward and blew the trumpets; and the ark of the covenant of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> followed them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And the armed men went ahead of the priests who blew the
    trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while they continued to blow the trumpets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But Joshua commanded the people, saying, &ldquo;You
    shall not
    shout nor let your voice be heard, nor let a word proceed from your mouth, until the day I tell you,
    &lsquo;Shout!&rsquo;
    Then
    you shall shout!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So he had the ark of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1042-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1042-2">d</a></sup></small>taken around the city, circling <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> once; then they came into the camp and spent the night in the camp.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now Joshua
    got up early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets of
    rams&rsquo; horns in front of the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> went on continually, and blew the
    trumpets;
    and the armed men went ahead of them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    while they continued to blow the trumpets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So the second day they marched around the city once and
    returned to the camp; they did the same for six days.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then on the
    seventh day they got up early at the dawning of the day and marched around the city in the same way seven times;
    only on that day did they march around the city seven times.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And at the seventh time, when the priests blew the
    trumpets, Joshua said to the people, &ldquo;Shout! For the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has given you the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But the city shall be designated for <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1043-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-1">e</a></sup></small>destruction, it and everything that is in it belongs
    to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; only Rahab the prostitute <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1043-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-2">f</a></sup></small>and all who
    are with her in the house shall live, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But as for you, only keep yourselves from the things
    designated for destruction, so that you do not covet <i class="calibre12">them</i> and take some of the designated
    things, and turn the camp of Israel into something designated for destruction and bring disaster on it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But all the silver and gold, and articles of bronze and
    iron are holy to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; they shall go into the treasury of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So the people shouted, and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1043-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-3">g</a></sup></small>the priests blew the trumpets; and when the people
    heard the sound of the trumpet, the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1043-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-4">h</a></sup></small>flat, so that the people went up into the city,
    everyone straight <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1043-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-5">i</a></sup></small>ahead, and they took the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>They <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1043-6" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1043-6">j</a></sup></small>utterly
    destroyed everything in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox, sheep, and donkey, with the edge of the
    sword.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> And Joshua
    said to the two men who had spied out the land, &ldquo;Go into the prostitute&rsquo;s house and bring the woman and
    all
    she has
    out of there, just as you have sworn to her.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So the young men who were spies went in and brought out
    Rahab, her father, her mother, her brothers, and all she had; they also brought out all her relatives, and placed
    them outside the camp of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then they burned the city with fire, and all that was
    in it. Only the silver and gold, and the articles of bronze and iron, they put into the treasury of the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1044-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1044-1">k</a></sup></small>house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>However, Rahab the prostitute and her father&rsquo;s
    household and all she had, Joshua <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1044-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1044-2">l</a></sup></small>spared; and she has lived in the
    midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Then Joshua
    made them take an oath at that time, saying, &ldquo;Cursed before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is the man
    who
    rises up and builds this city Jericho; with <i class="calibre12">the loss of</i> his firstborn he will lay its
    foundation, and with <i class="calibre12">the loss of</i> his youngest son he will set up its gates.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was with
    Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.
