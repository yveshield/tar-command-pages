    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> &ldquo;At that time the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said
    to me,
    &lsquo;Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first <i class="calibre12">two,</i> and come up to Me on
    the
    mountain, and make an <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source867-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then I will write on the tablets the words that were on
    the first tablets which you smashed to pieces, and you shall put them in the ark.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets
    of stone like the first <i class="calibre12">two,</i> and I went up on the mountain with the two tablets in my hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then He wrote on the tablets, like the first writing,
    the Ten <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source867-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f867-2">b</a></sup></small>Commandments which the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly;
    and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> gave them to me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then I turned and came down from the mountain, and I put
    the tablets in the ark which I had made; and they are there, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> commanded
    me.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> (Now the sons

    there he was buried, and his son Eleazar served as priest in his place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>From there they set out to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah
    to Jotbathah, a land of streams of water.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>At that time the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    singled out the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, to stand
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to serve Him and to bless in His name, until this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance
    with his brothers; the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is his inheritance, just as the L<span

    stayed on the mountain for forty days and forty nights like the first time, and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    listened to me that time also; the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was not willing to destroy you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me,
    &lsquo;Arise, proceed on your journey ahead of the people, so that they may go in and take possession of the land
    which I
    swore to their fathers to give them.&rsquo;
