  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Takes Consecrated Bread</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then David came to Nob, to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech
    came trembling to meet David and said to him, &ldquo;Why are you alone, and no one with you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>David said to Ahimelech the priest, &ldquo;The king has
    commissioned me with a matter and has said to me, &lsquo;No one is to know anything about the matter on which I am
    sending
    you and with which I have commissioned you; and I have directed the young men to a certain place.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Now then, what <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1365-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1365-1">a</a></sup></small>do you have on hand? Give <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1365-2">b</a></sup></small>me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be
    found.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>The priest answered David and said, &ldquo;There is no
    ordinary bread <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1365-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1365-3">c</a></sup></small>on hand, but there is consecrated bread, if only the
    young men have kept themselves from women.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>David answered the priest and said to him, &ldquo;Be
    assured,
    women have been denied to us as previously when I left and the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1365-4" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1365-4">d</a></sup></small>bodies of the
    young men were consecrated, though it was an ordinary journey; how much more then will <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1365-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1365-5">e</a></sup></small>their bodies be consecrated today?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So the priest gave him consecrated <i
      class="calibre12">bread;</i> for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which was removed from
    <i class="calibre12">its place</i> before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, in order to put hot bread <i
      class="calibre12">in its place</i> on the day it was taken away.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now one of the
    servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and his name was Doeg the
    Edomite, the chief of Saul&rsquo;s shepherds.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> David said to
    Ahimelech, &ldquo;Now is there no spear or sword <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1366-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1366-1">f</a></sup></small>on hand? For I brought neither
    my sword nor my weapons <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1366-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1366-2">g</a></sup></small>with me, because the king&rsquo;s matter was
    urgent.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then the priest said, &ldquo;The sword of Goliath the
    Philistine, whom you <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1366-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1366-3">h</a></sup></small>killed in the Valley of Elah, behold, it is wrapped
    in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, take <i class="calibre12">it.</i> For there is no
    other except it here.&rdquo; And David said, &ldquo;There is none like it; give it to me.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then David
    set out and fled that day from Saul, and went to Achish king of Gath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But the servants of Achish said to him, &ldquo;Is this
    not
    David, the king of the land? Did they not sing of this one as they danced, saying,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&lsquo;Saul has slain his thousands, </div>
  <div class="block">And David his ten thousands&rsquo;?&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>David took these words <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1367-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1367-1">i</a></sup></small>to heart and greatly feared Achish king of Gath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So he disguised his sanity <i
      class="calibre12">while</i> in their sight and acted insanely in their <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1367-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1367-2">j</a></sup></small>custody, and he scribbled on the doors of the gate,
    and drooled on his beard.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then Achish said to his servants, &ldquo;Look, you see
    the
    man is behaving like an insane person. Why do you bring him to me?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Do I lack insane people, that you have brought this one
    to behave like an insane person in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?&rdquo;
