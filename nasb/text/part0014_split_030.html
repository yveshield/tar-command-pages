    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then some came and reported to Jehoshaphat, saying,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Jehoshaphat was afraid and <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Judah gathered together to seek help from the L<span

    in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in front of the new courtyard;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>and he said, &ldquo;L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    God of

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Did You not, our God, drive out the inhabitants of this

    by coming to drive us out from Your possession which You have given us as an inheritance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Our God, will You not judge them? For we are powerless

    battle
    is not yours but God&rsquo;s.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Tomorrow, go down against them. Behold, they will come
    up by the ascent of Ziz, and you will find them at the end of the valley in front of the wilderness of Jeruel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Jehoshaphat
    bowed his head with <i class="calibre12">his</i> face to the ground, and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
    fell down before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, worshiping the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>The Levites, from the sons of the Kohathites and from
    the sons of the Korahites, stood up to praise the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel, with a very loud
    voice.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Enemies Destroy Themselves</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> They rose early in the morning and went out to the wilderness
    of Tekoa; and when they went out, Jehoshaphat stood and said, &ldquo;Listen to me, Judah and inhabitants of
    Jerusalem: Put
    your trust in the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God and you will endure. Put your trust in His prophets, and
    succeed.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>When he had consulted with the people, he appointed
    those who sang to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and those who praised <i class="calibre12">Him</i> in holy
    attire, as they went out before the army and said, &ldquo;Give thanks to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, for
    His
    faithfulness is everlasting.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>When they began singing and praising, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> set ambushes against the sons of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir, who had come against
    Judah; so they were struck down.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>For the sons of Ammon and Moab rose up against the
    inhabitants of Mount Seir, completely destroying <i class="calibre12">them;</i> and when they had finished with the
    inhabitants of Seir, they helped to destroy one another.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> When Judah
    came to the watchtower of the wilderness, they turned toward the multitude, and behold, they <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> corpses lying on the ground, and there was no survivor.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>When Jehoshaphat and his people came to take their
    spoils, they found much among them, <i class="calibre12">including</i> goods, <small class="small1"><sup

    themselves, more than they could carry. And they were taking the spoils for three days because there was <i

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Triumphant Return to Jerusalem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then on the fourth day they assembled in the Valley of

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Every man of Judah and Jerusalem returned, with
    Jehoshaphat at their head, returning to Jerusalem with joy, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had helped them
    to rejoice over their enemies.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>They came to Jerusalem with harps, lyres, and trumpets,
    to the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And the dread of God was on all the kingdoms of the
    lands when they heard that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had fought against the enemies of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So the kingdom of Jehoshaphat was at peace, for his God
    gave him rest on all sides.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Now
    Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah. He <i class="calibre12">was</i> thirty-five years old when he became king, and he
    reigned in Jerusalem for twenty-five years. And his mother&rsquo;s name <i class="calibre12">was</i> Azubah the
    daughter
    of Shilhi.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>He walked in the way of his father Asa and did not
    deviate from it, doing right in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>The high places, however, were not removed; the people
    had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their fathers.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">34</b></span> Now the rest
    of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2046-1"

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Alliance Displeases God</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">35</b></span> After this Jehoshaphat king of Judah allied himself with

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>So he allied himself with him to make ships to go to
    Tarshish, and they made the ships in Ezion-geber.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Then Eliezer the son of Dodavahu of Mareshah prophesied
    against Jehoshaphat, saying, &ldquo;Because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah, the L<span

    has destroyed your works.&rdquo; So the ships were wrecked and could not go to Tarshish.
