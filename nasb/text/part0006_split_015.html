      class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Moses, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Speak to the sons of Israel, and obtain from them
    a
    staff for each father&rsquo;s household: twelve staffs, from all their leaders for their fathers&rsquo; households.
    You shall
    write each man&rsquo;s name on his staff,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and write Aaron&rsquo;s name on the staff of Levi; for
    <i class="calibre12">there is to be</i> one staff for the head <i class="calibre12">of each</i> of their
    fathers&rsquo;
    households.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>You shall then leave them in the tent of meeting in
    front of the testimony, where I meet with you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And it will come about that the staff of the man whom I
    choose will sprout. So I will relieve Myself of the grumblings of the sons of Israel, who are grumbling against
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their
    leaders gave him a staff, one for each leader, for their fathers&rsquo; households, twelve staffs <i
      class="calibre12">in
      all,</i> with the staff of Aaron among their staffs.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Moses left the staffs before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> in the tent of the testimony.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Now on the
    next day Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, Aaron&rsquo;s staff for the house of Levi had
    sprouted and
    produced buds and bloomed with blossoms, and it yielded ripe almonds.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Moses then brought out all the staffs from the presence
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> to all the sons of Israel; and they looked, and each man took his staff.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses,
    &ldquo;Put the staff of Aaron back in front of the testimony <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source722-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f722-1">b</a></sup></small>to be kept as a

    grumblings against Me and they do not die.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Moses did <i class="calibre12">so;</i> just as the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded him, so he did.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then the sons
    of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, &ldquo;Behold, we are passing away, we are perishing, we are all perishing!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the
    tabernacle of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, must die. Are we to perish completely?&rdquo;
