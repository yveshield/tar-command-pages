      <p class="aleft">
            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to
            put
            David to death. But Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, greatly delighted in David.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So Jonathan informed David, saying, &ldquo;My
            father Saul is
            seeking to put you to death. Now then, please be on your guard in the morning, and stay in a hiding place
            and
            conceal yourself.

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then Jonathan spoke well of David to his father
            Saul and
            said to him, &ldquo;May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1355-4" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan, and Saul
            vowed,
            &ldquo;As the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, <i class="calibre12">David</i> shall not be put to
            death.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Jonathan called David, and Jonathan told
            him all

            with great slaughter, so that they fled from him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now there was an evil spirit from the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David
            was playing
            <i class="calibre12">the harp</i> with <i class="calibre12">his</i> hand.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And Saul tried to <small class="small1"><sup

            spear, but he escaped
            from Saul&rsquo;s presence, so that he stuck the spear into the wall. And David fled and escaped that night.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then
            Saul
            sent messengers to David&rsquo;s house to watch him, in order to put him to death in the morning. But
            Michal,
            David&rsquo;s
            wife, informed him, saying, &ldquo;If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be put to
            death!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So Michal let David down through a window, and
            he went
            and fled, and escaped.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And Michal took the <small class="small1"><sup

            on the bed, and put a quilt of goats&rsquo; hair at its head, and covered <i class="calibre12">it</i> with
            clothing.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When Saul sent messengers to take David, she
            said, &ldquo;He
            is sick.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Saul sent messengers to see David, saying,

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So Saul said to Michal, &ldquo;Why have you
            betrayed me like
            this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?&rdquo; And Michal said to Saul, &ldquo;He said to me,
            &lsquo;Let
            me
            go! Why should I
            put you to death?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> So
            David fled
            and escaped, and came to Samuel at Ramah; and he informed him of everything that Saul had done to him. And
            he and
            Samuel went and stayed in Naioth.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But it was reported to Saul, saying,
            &ldquo;Behold, David is
            at Naioth in Ramah.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then Saul sent messengers to take David, but
            when they
            saw the company of prophets prophesying, with Samuel standing <i class="calibre12">and</i> presiding over
            them, the
            Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied.

            time, yet
            they prophesied.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then he went to Ramah himself and came as far

            until he came to Naioth in Ramah.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>He also stripped off his clothes, and he too
            prophesied
