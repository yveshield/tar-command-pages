    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>They had mounted the ark of God on a new cart and moved
    it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new
    cart.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> But when they
    came to the threshing floor of Nacon, Uzzah reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then David became angry because <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So David was afraid of the L<span

    come to
    me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And David was unwilling to move the ark of the L<span

    Gittite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> blessed
    Obed-edom and all his household.

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now it was reported to King David, saying, &ldquo;The L<span

    God.&rdquo; So David went and brought the ark of God up from the house of Obed-edom to the city of David with joy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">so</i> it was, that <small

      class="small1">ORD</span> marched six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fattened steer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And David was dancing before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> with all <i class="calibre12">his</i> strength, and David was wearing a linen ephod.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up
    the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with joyful shouting and the sound of the trumpet.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then it
    happened, <i class="calibre12">as</i> the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was coming into the city of
    David, that Michal the daughter of Saul looked down through the window and saw King David leaping and dancing before
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and she was contemptuous of him in her heart.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Now they
    brought in the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and set it in its place inside the tent which David had
    pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>When David had finished offering the burnt offering and
    the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Further, he distributed to all the people, to all the
    multitude of Israel, both to men and women, a cake of bread, one of dates, and one of raisins to each one. Then all
    the people left, each to his house.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> But when
    David returned to bless his <i class="calibre12">own</i> household, Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet
    David and said, &ldquo;How the king of Israel dignified himself today! For he exposed himself today in the sight of
    his
    servants&rsquo; female slaves, as one of the rabble shamelessly exposes himself!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But David said to Michal, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">I
      was</i> before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, who preferred me to your father and to all his house, to
    appoint me as ruler over the people of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, over Israel. So I will <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1443-1" epub:type="noteref"

      class="small1">ORD</span>!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And I might demean myself <i class="calibre12">even</i>
    more than this and be lowly in my own sight, but with the female slaves of whom you have spoken, with them I am to
    be held in honor!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day
    of her death.
