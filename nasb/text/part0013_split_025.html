  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then David consulted with the captains of the thousands and
    the hundreds, with every leader.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>David said to all the assembly of Israel, &ldquo;If it
    <i class="calibre12">seems</i> good to you, and if it is from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1902-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1902-1">a</a></sup></small>let us send <i class="calibre12">word</i> everywhere
    to our kinsmen who remain in all the land of Israel, and to the priests and Levites who are with them in their
    cities with pasture lands, that they meet with us;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1902-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0014_split_010.html#f1902-2">b</a></sup></small>let us bring
    back the ark of our God to us, since we did not seek it in the days of Saul.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then all the assembly said that they would do so, for
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1902-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1902-3">c</a></sup></small>this was right in the eyes of all the people.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> So David
    assembled all Israel together, from the Shihor of Egypt to the entrance of Hamath, to bring the ark of God from
    Kiriath-jearim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>David and all Israel went up to Baalah, <i
      class="calibre12">that is,</i> to Kiriath-jearim, which belongs to Judah, to bring up from there the ark of God,
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> who is enthroned <i class="calibre12">above</i> the cherubim, where His name is
    called.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1903-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0014_split_010.html#f1903-1">d</a></sup></small>carried the
    ark of God on a new cart from the house of Abinadab, and Uzza and Ahio drove the cart.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>David and all Israel were celebrating before God with
    all <i class="calibre12">their</i> might, with songs and with lyres, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> When they came
    to the threshing floor of Chidon, Uzza put out his hand to hold the ark, because the oxen nearly overturned <i
      class="calibre12">it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But the anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    burned against Uzza, so He struck him because he had put out his hand toward the ark; and he died there before God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then David became angry because <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1904-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0014_split_010.html#f1904-1">e</a></sup></small>of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span> outburst against Uzza; and he called that place <small class="small1"><sup

    day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>David was afraid of God that day, saying, &ldquo;How
    can I
    bring the ark of God <i class="calibre12">home</i> to me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So David did not take the ark with him to the city of
    David, but took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And the ark of God remained with the family of
    Obed-edom in his house for three months; and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> blessed the family of Obed-edom
    and all that he had.
