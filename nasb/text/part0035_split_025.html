    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then after an interval of fourteen years I went up again to
    Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along also.

    of a revelation that I went up; and I submitted to them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but <i
      class="calibre12">I did so</i> in private to those who were of reputation, for fear that somehow I might be
    running, or had run, in vain.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But not even Titus, who was with me, though he was a
    Greek, was compelled to be circumcised.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Yet <i class="calibre12">it was a concern</i> because of
    the false brothers secretly brought in, who had sneaked in to spy on our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, in
    order to enslave us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>But we did not yield in subjection to them, even for an
    hour, so that the truth of the gospel would remain with you.

    difference to me; God shows no favoritism)—well, those who were of repute contributed nothing to me.
