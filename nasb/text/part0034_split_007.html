  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Festus, then, after arriving in the province, went up to
    Jerusalem from Caesarea three days later.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the chief priests and the leading men of the Jews
    brought charges against Paul, and they were pleading with <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

      class="calibre12">at the same time,</i> setting an ambush to kill him on the way).
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Festus then answered that Paul was being kept in custody
    in Caesarea, and that he himself was about to leave shortly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>&ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; he *said, &ldquo;have the
    influential
    men among
    you <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6779-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6779-5">e</a></sup></small>go there with me, and if there is anything wrong
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6779-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6779-6">f</a></sup></small>about the man, have them bring charges against
    him.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> After <i
      class="calibre12">Festus</i> had spent no more than eight or ten days among them, he went down to Caesarea, and on
    the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered that Paul be brought.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>After Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from
    Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many, and serious, charges against him which they could not prove,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>while Paul said in his own defense, &ldquo;I have not
    done
    anything wrong either against the Law of the Jews, or against the temple, or against Caesar.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, replied to
    Paul and said, &ldquo;Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6780-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6780-1">g</a></sup></small>stand trial
    before me on these <i class="calibre12">charges?</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But Paul said, &ldquo;I am standing before
    Caesar&rsquo;s
    tribunal,
    where I ought to be tried. I have done nothing wrong to <i class="calibre12">the</i> Jews, as you also very well
    know.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>If, therefore, I am in the wrong and have committed
    something deserving death, I am not trying to avoid execution; but if there is nothing to the accusations which
    these men are bringing against me, no one can hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then when Festus had conferred with <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6780-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6780-2">h</a></sup></small>his council, he answered, &ldquo;You have appealed
    to
    Caesar; to Caesar you shall go.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Now when
    several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea, paying their respects to Festus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And while they were spending many days there, Festus
    presented Paul&rsquo;s case to the king, saying, &ldquo;There is a man who was left as a prisoner by Felix;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>and when I was in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the
    elders of the Jews brought charges against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>I replied to them that it is not the custom of the
    Romans to hand over any person before the accused meets his accusers face to face, and has an opportunity to make
    his defense against the charges.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So after they had assembled here, I did not delay, but
    on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered that the man be brought.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>When the accusers stood up, they did not <i
      class="calibre12">begin</i> bringing any charges <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6781-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6781-1">i</a></sup></small>against him of crimes that I
    suspected,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>but they <i class="calibre12">simply</i> had some
    points of disagreement with him about their own <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6781-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6781-2">j</a></sup></small>religion and about a dead man,
    Jesus, whom Paul asserted to be alive.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And being at a loss how to investigate <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6781-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6781-3">k</a></sup></small>such matters, I <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6781-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6781-4">l</a></sup></small>asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and
    stand trial there on these matters.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But when Paul appealed to be held in custody for <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6781-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6781-5">m</a></sup></small>the Emperor&rsquo;s decision, I ordered that he be
    kept in
    custody until I send him to Caesar.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Agrippa <i class="calibre12">said</i> to Festus,
    &ldquo;I also would like to hear the man myself.&rdquo; &ldquo;Tomorrow,&rdquo; he *said, &ldquo;you shall hear
    him.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Paul before Agrippa</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> So, on the next day when Agrippa and Bernice came amid great
    pomp and entered the auditorium, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6782-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6782-1">n</a></sup></small>accompanied by the commanders
    and the prominent men of the city, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought <i class="calibre12">before them.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And Festus *said, &ldquo;King Agrippa, and all you
    gentlemen
    present with us, you see this man about whom all the people of the Jews appealed to me, both in Jerusalem and here,
    shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>But I found that he had committed nothing deserving
    death; and since he himself appealed to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6782-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6782-2">o</a></sup></small>the Emperor, I decided to send
    him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6782-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0034_split_010.html#f6782-3">p</a></sup></small>Yet, I have
    nothing definite about him to write to my lord. Therefore, I have brought him before you <i
      class="calibre12">all</i> and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the investigation has taken
    place, I may have something to write.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>For it seems absurd to me in sending a prisoner, not to
    indicate the charges against him as well.&rdquo;
