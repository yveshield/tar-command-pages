  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Consecration of Aaron and His Sons</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Moses,
    saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the
    garments and
    the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering, and the two rams and the basket of unleavened bread,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and assemble all the congregation at the doorway of the
    tent of meeting.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Moses did just as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> commanded him. When the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the tent of
    meeting,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Moses said to the congregation, &ldquo;This is the thing
    which
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded <i class="calibre12">us</i> to do.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then Moses had
    Aaron and his sons come near, and he washed them with water.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he put the tunic on <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source518-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f518-1">a</a></sup></small>Aaron and wrapped his waist with the sash, and
    clothed him with the robe and put the ephod on him; and he wrapped his waist with the artistic band of the ephod,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source518-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f518-2">b</a></sup></small>with which he fitted <i class="calibre12">it</i> to
    him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He then placed the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source518-3" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>He also placed the turban on his head, and on the
    turban, at its front, he placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had
    commanded Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Moses then
    took the anointing oil and anointed the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source519-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f519-1">e</a></sup></small>tabernacle and everything that
    was in it, and consecrated them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>He also sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times
    and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then he poured some of the anointing oil on
    Aaron&rsquo;s
    head and anointed him, to consecrate him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Next Moses had Aaron&rsquo;s sons come near, and he
    clothed
    them with tunics and wrapped their waists with sashes, and bound <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then he
    brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin
    offering.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Next <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source520-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f520-1">g</a></sup></small>Moses
    slaughtered <i class="calibre12">it</i> and took the blood and with his finger put <i class="calibre12">some of
      it</i> around on the horns of the altar, and purified the altar. Then he poured out <i class="calibre12">the rest
      of</i> the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>He also took all the fat that was on the entrails and
    the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source520-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f520-2">h</a></sup></small>lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat;
    and Moses offered it up in smoke on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But the bull and its hide, its flesh, and its refuse he
    burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then he
    presented the ram of the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source521-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f521-1">i</a></sup></small>Moses
    slaughtered <i class="calibre12">it</i> and sprinkled the blood around on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>When he had cut the ram into its pieces, Moses offered
    up the head and the pieces and the suet in smoke.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>After he had washed the entrails and the legs with
    water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a soothing aroma; it was an
    offering by fire to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded
    Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Then he
    presented the second ram, the ram of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source522-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f522-1">j</a></sup></small>ordination, and Aaron and his
    sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source522-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f522-2">k</a></sup></small>And Moses
    slaughtered <i class="calibre12">it</i> and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron&rsquo;s right
    ear, and
    on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>He also had Aaron&rsquo;s sons come near; and Moses put
    some
    of the blood on the lobe of their right ear, and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right
    foot. Moses then sprinkled <i class="calibre12">the rest of</i> the blood around on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>He then took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat
    that was on the entrails, and the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source522-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_027.html#f522-3">l</a></sup></small>lobe of the liver, the two
    kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And from the basket of unleavened bread that was before
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, he took one unleavened cake and one cake of bread <i class="calibre12">mixed
      with</i> oil and one wafer, and placed <i class="calibre12">them</i> on the portions of fat and on the right
    thigh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>He then put all <i class="calibre12">these</i> on the
    hands of Aaron and on the hands of his sons, and presented them as a wave offering before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Then Moses took them from their hands and offered them
    up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were an ordination offering for a soothing aroma; it was an
    offering by fire to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Moses also took the breast and presented it as a wave
    offering before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; it was Moses&rsquo; portion of the ram of ordination, just as
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> So Moses took
    some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments,
    on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him; and he consecrated Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and the
    garments of his sons with him.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Then Moses
    said to Aaron and to his sons, &ldquo;Boil the flesh at the doorway of the tent of meeting, and eat it there
    together with
    the bread which is in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, &lsquo;Aaron and his sons
    shall
    eat it.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>And the remainder of the flesh and of the bread you
    shall burn in the fire.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>And you shall not go outside the doorway of the tent of
    meeting for seven days, until the day that the period of your ordination is fulfilled; for he will <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source523-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f523-1">m</a></sup></small>ordain you through seven days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded <i
      class="calibre12">us</i> to do as has been done this day, to make atonement on your behalf.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>At the doorway of the tent of meeting, moreover, you
    shall remain day and night for seven days and fulfill <i class="calibre12">your</i> duty to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, so that you will not die; for so I have been commanded.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Aaron and his sons did all the things which the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded through Moses.
