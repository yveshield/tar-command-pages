    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> A great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And his tail *swept away a third of the stars of heaven
    and hurled them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she
    gave birth he might devour her Child.
