  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Hezekiah Shows His Treasures</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> At that time Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon,
    sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Hezekiah <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source4568-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0023_split_025.html#f4568-1">a</a></sup></small>was pleased,
    and let them see <i class="calibre12">all</i> his treasure house, the silver, the gold, the balsam oil, the
    excellent olive oil, his entire armory, and everything that was found in his treasuries. There was nothing in his
    house nor in all his realm that Hezekiah did not let them see.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said
    to him, &ldquo;What did these men say, and from where did they come to you?&rdquo; And Hezekiah said, &ldquo;They
    came to
    me from a
    far country, from Babylon.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then he said, &ldquo;What have they seen in your
    house?&rdquo;
    So
    Hezekiah <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4568-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0023_split_025.html#f4568-2">b</a></sup></small>answered, &ldquo;They have seen everything that is
    in my
    house; there is nothing among my treasuries that I have not let them see.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Isaiah then
    said to Hezekiah, &ldquo;Hear the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>&lsquo;Behold, the days are coming when everything that
    is in
    your house, and what your fathers have stored up to this day, will be carried to Babylon; nothing will be
    left,&rsquo;
    says the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&lsquo;And some of your sons who will come from you,
    whom you
    will father, will be taken away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of
    Babylon.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, &ldquo;The word of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which you have spoken is good.&rdquo; For he <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source4569-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0023_split_025.html#f4569-1">c</a></sup></small>thought, &ldquo;For
    there will be peace and truth in my days.&rdquo;
