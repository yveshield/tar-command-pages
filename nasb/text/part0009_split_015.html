  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Samson went down to Timnah, and he saw a woman in Timnah,
    <i class="calibre12">one</i> of the daughters of the Philistines.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So he came <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1211-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1211-1">a</a></sup></small>back and told his father and <small

          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1211-2">b</a></sup></small>mother, &ldquo;I saw a woman in Timnah, <i
      class="calibre12">one</i> of the daughters of the Philistines; so now, get her for me as a wife.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But his father and his mother said to him, &ldquo;Is
    there no
    woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1211-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1211-3">c</a></sup></small>our people,
    that you go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?&rdquo; Yet Samson said to his father, &ldquo;Get her
    for
    me,
    because she is right <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1211-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1211-4">d</a></sup></small>for me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>However, his father and mother did not know that this
    was of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, for He was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. And at that
    time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then Samson
    went down to Timnah with his father and mother, and came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and behold, a young lion
    <i class="calibre12">came</i> roaring toward him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And the Spirit of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    rushed upon him, so that he tore it apart as one tears apart a young goat, though he had nothing in his hand; but he
    did not tell his father or mother what he had done.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So he went down and talked to the woman; and she <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1212-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1212-1">e</a></sup></small>looked pleasing to Samson.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to
    look at the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So he took out <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1212-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1212-2">f</a></sup></small>the honey on his <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1212-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1212-3">g</a></sup></small>hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came
    to his father and mother, he gave <i class="calibre12">some</i> to them and they ate <i class="calibre12">it;</i>
    but he did not tell them that he had took the honey out of the body of the lion.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then his
    father went down to the woman; and Samson held a feast there, for the young men customarily did this.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>When they saw him, they brought thirty companions to be
    with him.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samson&rsquo;s Riddle</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then Samson said to them, &ldquo;Let me now propose a
    riddle
    for you; if you actually tell me <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1213-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1213-1">h</a></sup></small>the answer within the seven days
    of the feast, and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen wraps and thirty outfits of clothes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But if you are unable to tell me, then you shall give
    me thirty linen wraps and thirty outfits of clothes.&rdquo; And they said to him, &ldquo;Propose your riddle, so
    that we
    may
    hear it.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So he said to them,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;Out of the eater came something to eat, </div>
  <div class="block">And out of the strong came something sweet.&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    But they could not tell <i class="calibre12">the answer to</i> the riddle in three days.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then it came
    about on the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1214-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1214-1">i</a></sup></small>fourth day that they said to Samson&rsquo;s wife,
    &ldquo;Entice
    your husband, so that he will tell us the riddle, or we will burn you and your father&rsquo;s house with fire. Have
    you
    invited us to impoverish us? <i class="calibre12">Is this</i> not <i class="calibre12">so?</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Samson&rsquo;s wife wept in front of him and said,
    &ldquo;You
    only hate me, and you do not love me; you have proposed a riddle to the sons of my people, and have not told <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> to me.&rdquo; And he said to her, &ldquo;Behold, I have not told <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> to
    my
    father or mother; so should I tell you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>However she wept before him for seven days while their
    feast lasted. And on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. She then told the riddle to the
    sons of her people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So the men of the city said to him on the seventh day
    before the sun went down,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;What is sweeter than honey? </div>
  <div class="block">And what is stronger than a lion?&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    And he said to them, </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;If you had not plowed with my heifer, </div>
  <div class="block">You would not have found out my riddle.&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then the Spirit of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty men of them and took what they were wearing and gave
    the outfits of clothes to those who told the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father&rsquo;s
    house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But Samson&rsquo;s wife was <i
      class="calibre12">given</i> to
    his companion who had been his <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1214-2" epub:type="noteref"
