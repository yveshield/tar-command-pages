    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Then David
    took more wives in Jerusalem, and David fathered more sons and daughters.

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king
    over all Israel, all the Philistines went up in search of David; and David heard about it and went out against them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now the Philistines had come and carried out a raid in
    the Valley of Rephaim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>David inquired of God, saying, &ldquo;Shall I go up
    against
    the Philistines? And will You hand them over to me?&rdquo; Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to him,
    &ldquo;Go up,
    for I will hand them over to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So they came up to Baal-perazim, and David <small

    broken
    through my enemies by my hand, like the breakthrough of waters.&rdquo; Therefore they named that place <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>They abandoned their gods there; so David gave the
    order and they were burned with fire.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> The
    Philistines carried out yet another raid in the valley.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>David inquired again of God, and God said to him,
