            Samson
            visited his wife with a young goat, and said, &ldquo;I will go in to my wife in <i class="calibre12">her</i>

            But
            her father did not let him enter.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Her father said, &ldquo;I really thought that

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Samson then said to them, &ldquo;This time I
            will have
            been
            blameless regarding the Philistines when I do them harm.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And Samson went and caught three hundred

            took torches, and turned <i class="calibre12">the jackals</i> tail to tail and put one torch in the middle
            between

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>When he had set fire to the torches, he released

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then the Philistines said, &ldquo;Who did
            this?&rdquo; And <i class="calibre12">some</i> said, &ldquo;Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because

            his companion.&rdquo; So
            the Philistines came up and burned her and her father <i class="calibre12">to death</i> with fire.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Samson said to them, &ldquo;If this is how

            the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then three thousand men of Judah went down to
            the cleft
            of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, &ldquo;Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What
            then is
            this
            that you have done to us?&rdquo; And he said to them, &ldquo;Just as they did to me, so I have done to
            them.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then they said to him, &ldquo;We have come down
            to bind
            you
            so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.&rdquo; And Samson said to them, &ldquo;Swear to me that you

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So they said to <small class="small1"><sup

            brought him up
