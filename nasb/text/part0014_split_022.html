  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> When the kingdom of Rehoboam was established and strong, he
    and all Israel with him abandoned the Law of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And it came about in King Rehoboam&rsquo;s fifth year,
    because
    they had been unfaithful to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, that Shishak king of Egypt came up against
    Jerusalem
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>with 1,200 chariots and sixty thousand horsemen. And the
    people who came with him from Egypt were innumerable: the Lubim, the Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And he captured the fortified cities of Judah and came
    as far as Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the
    princes of Judah who had gathered at Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, &ldquo;This is what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;You have abandoned Me, so I also have abandoned you <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2016-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2016-1">a</a></sup></small>to Shishak.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves
    and said, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is righteous.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> When the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> came to Shemaiah, saying, &ldquo;They have humbled themselves, <i
      class="calibre12">so</i> I
    will not destroy them; and I will grant them a little deliverance, and My wrath will not be poured out on Jerusalem
    by means of Shishak.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But they will become his slaves, so that they may learn
    <i class="calibre12">the difference between</i> My service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Plunder Impoverishes Judah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> So Shishak king of Egypt went up against Jerusalem, and he
    took the treasures of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and the treasures of the king&rsquo;s
    palace. He
    took everything; he even took the gold shields which Solomon had made.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then King Rehoboam made shields of bronze in their
    place and committed them to the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2017-1"

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2017-2">c</a></sup></small>guards who guarded the entrance of the king&rsquo;s
    house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>As often as the king entered the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2017-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2017-3">d</a></sup></small>guards came and carried them and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And when he humbled himself, the anger of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> turned away from him, so as not to destroy <i class="calibre12">him</i> completely; and
    conditions were also good in Judah.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> So King
    Rehoboam became powerful in Jerusalem and reigned <i class="calibre12">there.</i> For Rehoboam was forty-one years
    old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the L<span

    name
    was Naamah the Ammonitess.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But he did evil because he did not set his heart to
    seek the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now the acts

    Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, according to genealogical enrollment? And <i class="calibre12">there
      were</i> wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And Rehoboam <small class="small1"><sup

    of David; and his son Abijah became king in his place.
