    Esther got up and stood before the king.

    have
    found favor before him, and the matter <i class="calibre12">seems</i> proper to the king and I am pleasing in his
    sight, let it be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman, the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he wrote
    to eliminate the Jews who are in all the king&rsquo;s provinces.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For how can I endure to see the disaster which will
    happen to my people, and how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and to Mordecai
    the Jew, &ldquo;Behold, I have given the house of Haman to Esther, and they have hanged him on the wooden <i
