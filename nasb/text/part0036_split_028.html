            firmly to our
            confession.

            sympathize
            with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things just as <i class="calibre12">we are, yet</i>
            without
            sin.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Therefore let&rsquo;s approach the throne of
            grace
            with
            confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace for help at the time of <i class="calibre12">our</i>
