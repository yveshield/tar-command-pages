  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then they informed David, saying, &ldquo;Behold, the
    Philistines are
    fighting against Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So David inquired of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, saying, &ldquo;Shall I go and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1374-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1374-1">a</a></sup></small>attack these
    Philistines?&rdquo; And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to David, &ldquo;Go and <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But David&rsquo;s men said to him, &ldquo;Behold, we are
    fearful
    here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the ranks of the Philistines?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So David inquired of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> once more. And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> answered him and said, &ldquo;Arise,
    go
    down to Keilah, for I am going to hand the Philistines over to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then David and his men went to Keilah and fought the
    Philistines; and he drove away their livestock and struck them with a great slaughter. So David saved the
    inhabitants of Keilah.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now it came
    about, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, <i class="calibre12">that</i> he came down <i
      class="calibre12">with</i> an ephod in his hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When it was reported to Saul that David had come to
    Keilah, Saul said, &ldquo;God has handed him over to me, for he shut himself in by entering a city with double gates
    and
    bars.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So Saul summoned all the people for war, to go down to
    Keilah to besiege David and his men.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him;
    so he said to Abiathar the priest, &ldquo;Bring the ephod here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then David said, &ldquo;L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God
    of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul is seeking to come to Keilah to destroy the city on my
    account.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to him? Will
    Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel, please, tell Your
    servant.&rdquo; And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said, &ldquo;He will come down.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then David said, &ldquo;Will the citizens of Keilah
    hand me
    and my men over to Saul?&rdquo; And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said, &ldquo;They will hand you
    over.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then David and his men, about six hundred, rose up and
    departed from Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When it was reported to Saul that David had escaped from
    Keilah, he gave up <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1375-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1375-1">b</a></sup></small>the pursuit.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and
    remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand
    him over to him.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Saul Pursues David</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life while
    David was in the wilderness of Ziph, at Horesh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And Jonathan, Saul&rsquo;s son, set out and went to
    David at
    Horesh, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1376-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1376-1">c</a></sup></small>encouraged him in God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>He said to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, because the
    hand of
    Saul my father will not find you, and you will be king over Israel, and I will be second in command to you; and Saul
    my father knows that as well.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So the two of them made a covenant before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>; and David stayed at Horesh, while Jonathan went to his house.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then Ziphites
    came up to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &ldquo;Is David not keeping himself hidden with us in the strongholds at Horesh,
    on the
    hill of Hachilah, which is south of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1377-1"

      be</i> to hand him over to the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Saul said, &ldquo;May you be blessed of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, since you have had compassion on me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Go now, be more persistent, and investigate and see his
    place where <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1377-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1377-4">g</a></sup></small>he is hiding, <i class="calibre12">and</i> who has
    seen him there; for I am told that he is very cunning.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So look, and learn about all the hiding places where he
    keeps himself hidden, and return to me with certainty, and I will go with you; and if he is in the land, I will
    search him out among all the thousands of Judah.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> So they set
    out and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah to the south
    of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1378-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>When Saul and his men went to seek <i
      class="calibre12">him,</i> they informed David, and he came down to the rock and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.
    And when Saul heard <i class="calibre12">about it,</i> he pursued David in the wilderness of Maon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and
    his men on the other side of the mountain; and David was hurrying to get away from Saul, while Saul and his men were
    surrounding David and his men to apprehend them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>But a messenger came to Saul, saying, &ldquo;Hurry and
    come,
    for the Philistines have launched an attack against the land!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to
    confront the Philistines; therefore they called that place <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
