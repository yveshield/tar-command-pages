  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Esther Learns of Haman&rsquo;s Plot</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> When Mordecai learned of everything that had been done, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2258-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2258-1">a</a></sup></small>he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth and ashes, and
    went out into the midst of the city and wailed loudly and bitterly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And he came as far as the king&rsquo;s gate, for no one
    was to
    enter the king&rsquo;s gate clothed in sackcloth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>In each and every province where the command and decree
    of the king came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting, weeping, and mourning rites; and many had
    sackcloth and ashes spread out as a bed.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Then
    Esther&rsquo;s
    attendants and her eunuchs came and informed her, and the queen was seized by great fear. And she sent garments to
    clothe Mordecai so that he would remove his sackcloth from him, but he did not accept <i class="calibre12">them.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then Esther summoned Hathach from the king&rsquo;s
    eunuchs,
    whom <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2259-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2259-1">b</a></sup></small>the king had appointed to attend her, and ordered
    him <i class="calibre12">to go</i> to Mordecai to learn what this <i class="calibre12">mourning was</i> and why it
    <i class="calibre12">was happening.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the city square, in
    front of the king&rsquo;s gate.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Mordecai told him everything that had happened to him,
    and the exact amount of money that Haman had promised to pay to the king&rsquo;s treasuries for the elimination of
    the
    Jews.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>He also gave him a copy of the text of the edict which
    had been issued in Susa for their annihilation, so that he might show Esther and inform her, and to order her to go
    in to the king to implore his favor and plead with him for her people.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> So Hathach
    came back and reported Mordecai&rsquo;s words to Esther.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Esther spoke to Hathach and ordered him <i
      class="calibre12">to reply</i> to Mordecai:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>&ldquo;All the king&rsquo;s servants and the people of
    the
    king&rsquo;s
    provinces know that for any man or woman who comes to the king in the inner courtyard, who is not summoned, he has
    <i class="calibre12">only</i> one law, that he be put to death, unless the king holds out to him the golden scepter
    so that he may live. And I have not been summoned to come to the king for these thirty days.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And they reported Esther&rsquo;s words to Mordecai.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then Mordecai
    told <i class="calibre12">them</i> to reply to Esther, &ldquo;Do not imagine that you in the king&rsquo;s palace can
    escape any
    more than all the <i class="calibre12">other</i> Jews.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For if you keep silent at this time, liberation and
    rescue will arise for the Jews from another place, and you and your father&rsquo;s house will perish. And who knows
    whether you have not attained royalty for such a time as this?&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Esther Plans to Intercede</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Esther told <i class="calibre12">them</i> to reply
    to Mordecai,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>&ldquo;Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Susa,
    and
    fast for me; do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants also will fast in the same way.
    And then I will go in to the king, which is not in accordance with the law; and if I perish, I perish.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So Mordecai went away and did just as Esther had
    commanded him.
