    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But Jacob said to his mother Rebekah, &ldquo;Behold, my

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Rebekah took the <small class="small1"><sup

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then he came

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Jacob said to his father, &ldquo;I am Esau your

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So Jacob came close to his father Isaac, and he touched
    him and said, &ldquo;The voice is the voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were
    hairy like his brother Esau&rsquo;s hands; so he blessed him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Are you really my son Esau?&rdquo;
    And he
    said,
    &ldquo;I am.&rdquo;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So he came close and kissed him; and when he smelled

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out
    with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, &ldquo;Bless me, me as well, my father!&rdquo;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>But Isaac replied to Esau, &ldquo;Behold, I have made
