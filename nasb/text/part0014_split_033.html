  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now in the seventh year, Jehoiada gathered his courage, and
    took captains of hundreds: Azariah the son of Jeroham, Ishmael the son of Johanan, Azariah the son of Obed, Maaseiah
    the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri, <i class="calibre12">and they entered</i> into a covenant with
    him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And they went throughout Judah and gathered the Levites
    from all the cities of Judah, and the heads of the fathers&rsquo; <i class="calibre12">households</i> of Israel, and
    they
    came to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then all the assembly made a covenant with the king in
    the house of God. And <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2058-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2058-1">a</a></sup></small>Jehoiada said to them, &ldquo;Behold, the
    king&rsquo;s son
    shall
    reign, as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has spoken concerning the sons of David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>This is the thing which you shall do: a third of you, of
    the priests and Levites who come in on the Sabbath, <i class="calibre12">shall be</i> gatekeepers,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>and a third <i class="calibre12">shall be</i> at the
    king&rsquo;s house, and a third at the Gate of the Foundation; and all the people <i class="calibre12">shall be</i>
    in the
    courtyards of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But no one is to enter the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> except the priests and the ministering Levites; they may enter, for they are holy. And
    all the people are to keep the command of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The Levites will surround the king, each man with his
    weapons in his hand; and whoever enters the house is to be put to death. Therefore be with the king when he comes in
    and when he goes out.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> The Levites
    and all Judah did according to all that Jehoiada the priest commanded. And each one of them took his men who were to
    come in on the Sabbath, with those who were to go out on the Sabbath, for Jehoiada the priest did not dismiss <i
      class="calibre12">any of</i> the divisions.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Jehoiada the priest gave the captains of hundreds
    the spears and the shields and quivers which had been King David&rsquo;s, which were in the house of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>He stationed all the people, each man with his weapon
    in his hand, from the right <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2059-1" epub:type="noteref"

    around the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then they brought out the king&rsquo;s son and put the
    crown
    on him, and <i class="calibre12">gave him</i> the testimony and made him king. And Jehoiada and his sons anointed
    him and said, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">Long</i> live the king!&rdquo;

    praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said, &ldquo;Conspiracy! Conspiracy!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of
    hundreds who were appointed over the army, and said to them, &ldquo;Bring her out <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    and when she arrived at the entrance of the Horse Gate of the king&rsquo;s house, they put her to death there.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Reforms Carried Out</i></p>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And all the people went to the house of Baal and tore

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Moreover, Jehoiada placed the offices of the house of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> under the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2061-1"

    was at rest. For they had put Athaliah to death with the sword.
