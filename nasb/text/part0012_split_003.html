    was still in Egypt, where he had fled from the presence of King Solomon).
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then they sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and
    summoned him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and spoke to Rehoboam, saying,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then he said to them, &ldquo;Depart <small

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And King
    Rehoboam consulted with the elders who had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1632-1"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>He said to them, &ldquo;What advice do you give, so that

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And the young men who had grown up with him spoke to
    him, saying, &ldquo;This is what you should say to this people who spoke to you, saying: &lsquo;Your father made our
    yoke
    heavy,
    now you make it lighter for us!&rsquo; You should speak this way to them: &lsquo;My little finger is thicker than my
    father&rsquo;s
    waist!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Now then, my father loaded you with a heavy yoke; yet I

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So the king did not listen to the people; because it

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> When all Israel <i class="calibre12">saw</i> that the king

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was in charge of

    hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So Israel has broken with the house of David to this
    day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> And it came
    about, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, that they sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and called him

    David.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Now when
    Rehoboam had come to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen
    warriors, to fight against the house of Israel to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God,

    says: &ldquo;You shall not go up nor fight against your relatives the sons of Israel; return, every man to his

    this thing has come from Me.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So they listened to the word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>,
    and returned to go <i class="calibre12">their way</i> in accordance with the word of the L<span

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And Jeroboam said in his heart, &ldquo;Now the kingdom
