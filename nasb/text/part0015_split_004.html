  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Manasseh Succeeds Hezekiah in Judah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he
    reigned for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He did evil in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> according to the abominations of the nations whom the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    dispossessed before the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For he rebuilt the high places which his father Hezekiah
    had torn down; he also set up altars for the Baals and made <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2101-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2101-1">a</a></sup></small>Asherim, and
    he worshiped all the heavenly <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2101-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2101-2">b</a></sup></small>lights and served them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>He built altars in the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> of which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had said, &ldquo;My name shall be in
    Jerusalem
    forever.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>He built altars for all the heavenly <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2101-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2101-3">c</a></sup></small>lights in the two courtyards of the house of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He also made his sons pass through the fire in the
    Valley of Ben-hinnom; and he practiced witchcraft, used divination, practiced sorcery, and dealt with mediums and
    spiritists. He did much evil in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, provoking Him to anger.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he put the carved image of the idol which he had
    made in the house of God, of which God had said to David and his son Solomon, &ldquo;In this house and in Jerusalem,
    which
    I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will put My name forever;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>and I will not remove the foot of Israel again from the
    land which I have appointed for your fathers, if only they will take care to do everything that I have commanded
    them according to all the Law, the statutes, and the ordinances <i class="calibre12">given</i> through Moses.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So Manasseh encouraged Judah and the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem to do more evil than the nations whom the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> destroyed before the sons of
    Israel.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Manasseh&rsquo;s Idolatry Rebuked</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Manasseh and
    his people, but they paid no attention.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Therefore the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> brought
    the commanders of the army of the king of Assyria against them, and they captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him
    with bronze <i class="calibre12">chains,</i> and led him to Babylon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>When he was in distress, he appeased the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>When he prayed to Him, He was moved by him and heard
    his pleading, and brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <i class="calibre12">alone is</i> God.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Now after
    this he built the outer wall of the city of David on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, up to the entrance of
    the Fish Gate; and he encircled the Ophel <i class="calibre12">with it</i> and made it very high. Then he put army
    commanders in all the fortified cities in Judah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>He also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the
    house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, as well as all the altars which he had built on the mountain of the
    house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and in Jerusalem, and he threw <i class="calibre12">them</i> outside
    the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>He set up the altar of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and sacrificed peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it; and he ordered Judah to
    serve the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>However, the people still sacrificed on the high
    places, <i class="calibre12">although</i> only to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> their God.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Now the rest
    of the acts of Manasseh and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers who spoke to him in the name of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel, behold, they are among the records of the kings of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>His prayer also and <i class="calibre12">how God</i>
    was moved by him, and all his sin, his unfaithfulness, and the sites on which he built high places and erected the

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2102-1">d</a></sup></small>Asherim and the carved images, before he humbled
    himself, behold, they are written in the records of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So Manasseh <small class="small1"><sup

    his own house. And his son Amon became king in his place.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Amon Becomes King in Judah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Amon <i class="calibre12">was</i> twenty-two years old when
    he became king, and he reigned for two years in Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>He did evil in the sight of the L<span

    which his father Manasseh had made, and he served them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Furthermore, he did not humble himself before the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> as his father Manasseh had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    multiplied <i class="calibre12">his</i> guilt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Finally, his servants conspired against him and put him
    to death in his own house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>But the people of the land <small class="small1"><sup
