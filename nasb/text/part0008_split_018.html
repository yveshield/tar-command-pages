            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So the men <i class="calibre12">of Israel</i>
            took some

            However, it
            came about at the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, that they heard that they were

            their
            cities on the third day. Now their cities <i class="calibre12">were</i> Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and

            had sworn to them by the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel. And the whole congregation
            grumbled
            against the leaders.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But all the leaders said to the whole
            congregation, &ldquo;We
            have sworn to them by the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, and now we cannot touch them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>This we will do to them, even let them live, so
            that
            wrath will not be on us because of the oath which we swore to them.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So the leaders said to them, &ldquo;Let them
            live.&rdquo; And they
            became gatherers of firewood and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1058-3"

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Then
            Joshua
            called for them and spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;Why have you deceived us, saying, &lsquo;We are very far

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>So they answered Joshua and said, &ldquo;Since

            all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land before you, we feared greatly for our lives
            because of
            you, and did this thing.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And now behold, we are in your hands; do to us

            the sons of Israel, and they did not kill them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>But on that day Joshua made them gatherers of
