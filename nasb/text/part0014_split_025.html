    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>In those times there was no peace for him who went out

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Now when Asa heard these words and the <small

    spoke, he took courage and removed the abominable idols from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities
    which he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He then restored the altar of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> which was in front of the porch of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and those from
    Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who resided with them, for many defected to him from Israel when they saw that the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> his God was with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So they assembled at Jerusalem in the third month of
    the fifteenth year of Asa&rsquo;s reign.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>They sacrificed to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    on that day seven hundred oxen and seven thousand sheep from the spoils they had brought.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>They entered into the covenant to seek the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God of their fathers with all their heart and soul;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>and whoever would not seek the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> God of Israel was to be put to death, whether small or great, man or woman.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Moreover, they made an oath to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> with a loud voice, with shouting, trumpets, and with horns.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>All Judah rejoiced concerning the oath, for they had
    sworn with all their heart and had sought Him <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2028-2"

    removed Maacah, the mother of King Asa, from the <i class="calibre12">position of</i> queen mother, because she had

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But the high places were not removed from Israel;
    nevertheless Asa&rsquo;s heart was blameless all his days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>He brought into the house of God the dedicated things
    of his father and his own dedicated things: silver, gold, and utensils.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And there was no <i class="calibre12">more</i> war
    until the thirty-fifth year of Asa&rsquo;s reign.
