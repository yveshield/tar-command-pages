    the church, to do them harm.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And he had James the brother of John executed with a
    sword.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>When he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to
    arrest Peter as well. (Now <i class="calibre12">these</i> were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>When he had arrested him, he put him in prison, turning

      class="calibre12">only</i> after the Passover to bring him before the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So Peter was kept in the prison, but prayer for him was
    being made to God <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6700-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6700-4">d</a></sup></small>intensely by the church.

    forward, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards in front of the door were
    watching over the prison.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And behold, an angel of the Lord suddenly stood near <i
      class="calibre12">Peter,</i> and a light shone in the cell; and he struck Peter&rsquo;s side and woke him, saying,
    &ldquo;Get
    up quickly.&rdquo; And his chains fell off his hands.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And the angel said to him, &ldquo;Put on your belt and
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6701-2" epub:type="noteref"

    *said
    to him, &ldquo;Wrap your cloak around you and follow me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And he went out and continued to follow, and <i
      class="calibre12">yet</i> he did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was
    seeing a vision.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now when they had passed the first and second guard,
    they came to the iron gate that leads into the city, which opened for them by itself; and they went out and went
    along one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>When Peter came <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6701-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6701-3">g</a></sup></small>to himself, he said, &ldquo;Now I know for sure that
    the
    Lord has sent forth His angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And when he realized <i class="calibre12">this,</i> he
    went to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was also called Mark, where many were gathered together and were
    praying.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>When he knocked at the door of the gate, a slave woman
    named Rhoda came to answer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When she recognized Peter&rsquo;s voice, because of her
    joy
    she did not open the gate, but ran in and announced that Peter was standing in front of the gate.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>They said to her, &ldquo;You are out of your
    mind!&rdquo; But
    she
    kept insisting that it was so. They said, &ldquo;It is his angel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened
    <i class="calibre12">the door,</i> they saw him and were amazed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he
    described to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, &ldquo;Report these things to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6701-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6701-5">i</a></sup></small>James and the brothers.&rdquo; Then he left and went
    to
    another place.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Now when day
    came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers <i class="calibre12">as to</i> <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>When Herod had searched for him and had not found him,
    he examined the guards and ordered that they be led away <i class="calibre12">to execution.</i> Then he went down
    from Judea to Caesarea and was spending time there.
