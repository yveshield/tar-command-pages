  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel Crosses the Jordan</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Joshua got up early in the morning; and he and all the
    sons of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they spent the night there before they crossed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then at the end of three days the officers went through
    the midst of the camp;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and they commanded the people, saying, &ldquo;When you
    see the
    ark of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God with the Levitical priests carrying it, then
    you shall set out from your place and go after it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>However, there shall be a distance between you and it of
    about <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1030-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1030-1">a</a></sup></small>two thousand cubits by measurement. Do not come near
    it, so that you may know the way by which you shall go, for you have not passed this way before.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then Joshua
    said to the people, &ldquo;Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will do miracles
    among
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, &ldquo;Take up
    the
    ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people.&rdquo; So they took up the ark of the covenant and went
    ahead of
    the people.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> said to Joshua, &ldquo;This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so
    that
    they will know that just as I have been with Moses, I will be with you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So you shall command the priests who are carrying the
    ark of the covenant, saying, &lsquo;When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand <i
      class="calibre12">still</i> in the Jordan.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Joshua said to the sons of Israel, &ldquo;Come
    here, and
    hear the words of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And Joshua said, &ldquo;By this you will know that the
    living
    God is among you, and that He will assuredly drive out from you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the
    Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the
    earth is crossing over ahead of you into the Jordan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Now then, take for yourselves twelve men from the
    tribes of Israel, one man for each tribe.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And it will come about when the soles of the feet of
    the priests who carry the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the Lord of all the earth, rest in the waters
    of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, <i class="calibre12">that is,</i> the waters which are
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1031-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1031-1">b</a></sup></small>flowing down from above; and they will stand in one
    heap.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> So when the
    people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant before the
    people,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>and when those who were carrying the ark came up to the
    Jordan and the feet of the priests carrying the ark <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1032-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1032-1">c</a></sup></small>stepped down
    into the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the days of harvest),
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>then the waters which were <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1032-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1032-2">d</a></sup></small>flowing down from above stood <i
      class="calibre12">and</i> rose up in one heap, a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan;
    and those which were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1032-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1032-2">d</a></sup></small>flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt
    Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan while all Israel crossed
    on dry ground, until all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan.
