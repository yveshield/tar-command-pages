  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samson&rsquo;s Weakness</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, and had
    relations with her.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small><i class="calibre12">When it was reported</i> to the
    Gazites, saying, &ldquo;Samson has come here,&rdquo; they surrounded <i class="calibre12">the place</i> and lay in
    wait
    for him
    all night at the gate of the city. And they kept silent all night, saying, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">Let&rsquo;s
      wait</i>
    until the morning light, then we will kill him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Now Samson lay <i class="calibre12">asleep</i> until
    midnight, and at midnight he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two doorposts, and pulled
    them up along with the bars; then he put <i class="calibre12">them</i> on his shoulders, and carried them up to the
    top of the mountain which is opposite Hebron.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> After this it
    came about that he was in love with a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So the governors of the Philistines came up to her and
    said to her, &ldquo;Entice him, and see where his great strength <i class="calibre12">lies</i> and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1218-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1218-1">a</a></sup></small>how we can overpower him so that we may bind him to
    humble him. Then we will each give you 1,100 <i class="calibre12">pieces</i> of silver.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Delilah said to Samson, &ldquo;Please tell me where
    your
    great strength <i class="calibre12">lies,</i> and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1218-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1218-2">b</a></sup></small>how you can be bound to humble
    you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And Samson said to her, &ldquo;If they bind me with
    seven
    fresh <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1218-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1218-3">c</a></sup></small><i class="calibre12">animal</i> tendons that have
    not been dried, then I will become weak and be like any <i class="calibre12">other</i> man.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then the governors of the Philistines brought up to her
    seven fresh <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1218-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1218-4">d</a></sup></small><i class="calibre12">animal</i> tendons that had not
    been dried, and she bound him with them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now she had <i class="calibre12">men</i> prepared for an
    ambush in an inner room. And she said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; But he tore the
    tendons
    to
    pieces just like a thread of flax is torn apart when it <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1218-5" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1218-5">e</a></sup></small>comes too
    close to fire. So his strength was not discovered.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then Delilah
    said to Samson, &ldquo;Behold, you have toyed with me and told me lies; now please tell me <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1219-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then He said to her, &ldquo;If they bind me tightly
    with new
    ropes <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1219-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1219-2">g</a></sup></small>which have not been used, then I will become weak
    and be like any <i class="calibre12">other</i> man.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and
    said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; For the <i class="calibre12">men</i> in the ambush
    <i class="calibre12">were</i> waiting in the inner room. But he tore <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1219-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1219-3">h</a></sup></small>the ropes from
    his arms like thread.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then Delilah
    said to Samson, &ldquo;Up to now you have toyed with me and told me lies; tell me <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1220-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1220-1">i</a></sup></small>how you may be bound.&rdquo; And he said to her,
    &ldquo;If
    you
    weave the seven locks of my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1220-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1220-2">j</a></sup></small>hair with the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1220-3" epub:type="noteref"

          id="source1220-4" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1220-4">l</a></sup></small>[and fasten it
    with the pin, then I will be weak like any <i class="calibre12">other</i> man.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven locks of his
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1220-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1220-5">m</a></sup></small>hair with the web]. And she fastened <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> with the pin and said to him, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you, Samson!&rdquo; But he
    awoke
    from
    his sleep and pulled out the pin of the loom and the web.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Delilah Extracts His Secret</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then she said to him, &ldquo;How can you say, &lsquo;I love
    you,&rsquo;
    when
    your heart is not with me? You have toyed with me these three times and have not told me where your great strength
    is.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And it came about, when she pressed him daily with her
    words and urged him, that his soul was <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1221-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_022.html#f1221-1">n</a></sup></small>annoyed to death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So he told her all <i class="calibre12">that was in</i>
    his heart and said to her, &ldquo;A razor has never come on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my
    mother&rsquo;s
    womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me and I will become weak and be like any <i
      class="calibre12">other</i> man.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> When Delilah
    saw that he had told her all <i class="calibre12">that was in</i> his heart, she sent <i class="calibre12">word</i>
    and called the governors of the Philistines, saying, &ldquo;Come up once more, for he has told me all <i
      class="calibre12">that is in</i> his heart.&rdquo; Then the governors of the Philistines came up to her and
    brought up
    the money in their hands.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And she made him sleep on her knees, and called for a
    man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to humble him, and his strength left him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>She said, &ldquo;The Philistines are upon you,
    Samson!&rdquo;
    And
    he awoke from his sleep and said, &ldquo;I will go out as at other times and shake myself free.&rdquo; But he did
    not know
    that
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had departed from him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his
    eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and restrained him with bronze chains, and he became a grinder in the
    prison.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>However, the hair of his head began to grow <i
      class="calibre12">again</i> after it was shaved off.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now the
    governors of the Philistines assembled to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to celebrate, for they
    said,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;Our god has handed Samson our enemy over to us.&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>When the people saw him, they praised their god, for
    they said,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;Our god has handed our enemy over to us, </div>
  <div class="block">Even the destroyer of our country, </div>
  <div class="block">Who has killed many of us.&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>It so happened when <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1222-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1222-1">o</a></sup></small>they were in high spirits, that they said,
    &ldquo;Call for
    Samson, that he may amuse us.&rdquo; So they called for Samson from the prison, and he <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1222-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1222-2">p</a></sup></small>entertained them. And they made him stand between
    the pillars.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then Samson said to the boy who was holding his hand,
    &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1222-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1222-3">q</a></sup></small>Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, so
    that I may lean against them.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Now the house was full of men and women, and all the
    governors of the Philistines were there. And about three thousand men and women were on the roof looking on while
    Samson was entertaining <i class="calibre12">them.</i>

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samson Is Avenged</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Then Samson called to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    and said, &ldquo;Lord <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1223-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1223-1">r</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span>, please remember me
    and please strengthen me just this time, O God, that I may at once take vengeance on the Philistines for my two
    eyes.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Then Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the
    house rested, and braced himself against them, the one with his right hand and the other with his left.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>And Samson said, &ldquo;Let <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1223-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_022.html#f1223-2">s</a></sup></small>me die with the Philistines!&rdquo; And he pushed
    outwards
    powerfully, so that the house fell on the governors and all the people who were in it. And the dead whom he killed
    at his death were more than those whom he killed during his lifetime.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Then his brothers and all his father&rsquo;s household
    came
    down and took him, and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. So
    he had judged Israel for twenty years.
