    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now a man was there who had been <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Jesus, upon seeing this man lying <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Jesus *said to him, &ldquo;Get up, pick up your pallet

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Immediately the man became well, and picked up his
    pallet and <i class="calibre12">began</i> to walk.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><b class="calibre9">N</b>ow it was a Sabbath on that day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So the Jews were saying to the man who was cured,
    &ldquo;It
    is a Sabbath, and it is not permissible for you to carry your pallet.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But he answered them, &ldquo;He who made me well was
    the one
    who said to me, &lsquo;Pick up your pallet and walk.&rsquo;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>They asked him, &ldquo;Who is the man who said to you,
    &lsquo;Pick
    <i class="calibre12">it</i> up and walk&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But the man who was healed did not know who it was, for
    Jesus had slipped away while there was a crowd in <i class="calibre12">that</i> place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Afterward, Jesus *found him in the temple and said to
    him, &ldquo;Behold, you have become well; do not sin anymore, so that nothing worse happens to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>The man went away, and informed the Jews that it was
    Jesus who had made him well.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus,
    because He was doing these things on a Sabbath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But He answered them, &ldquo;My Father <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6541-1" epub:type="noteref"

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus&rsquo; Equality with God</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>For this reason therefore the Jews were seeking all the
    more to kill Him, because He not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God His own Father, making
    Himself equal with God.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Therefore
    Jesus answered and was saying to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, unless
    <i class="calibre12">it is</i> something He sees the Father doing; for whatever <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6542-1" epub:type="noteref"

    the same way.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For the Father loves the Son and shows Him all things
    that He Himself is doing; and <i class="calibre12">the Father</i> will show Him greater works than these, so that
    you will be amazed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them
    life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wishes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For not even the Father judges anyone, but He has given
    all judgment to the Son,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the
    Father. The one who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> &ldquo;Truly,
    truly, I say to you, the one who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come
