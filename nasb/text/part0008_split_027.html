    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the whole congregation of the sons of Israel assembled at
    Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> But there
    remained among the sons of Israel seven tribes who had not divided their inheritance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Joshua said to the sons of Israel, &ldquo;How long

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And they shall divide it into seven portions; Judah
    shall stay in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall stay in their territory on the north.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And you shall write <i class="calibre12">a description

    cast lots for you here before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>For the Levites have no portion among you, because the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Then the men
    arose and went, and Joshua commanded those who went to write <i class="calibre12">a description of</i> the land,

    me; then
    I will cast lots for you here before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in Shiloh.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So the men went and passed through the land, and wrote
    <i class="calibre12">a description of</i> it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came to Joshua at the
    camp at Shiloh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Joshua then cast lots for them in Shiloh before the
