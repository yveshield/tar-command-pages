            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about after these things, that God tested
            Abraham,
            and said to him, &ldquo;Abraham!&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Here I am.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then He said, &ldquo;Take now your son, your
            only son, whom
            you love, Isaac, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the
            mountains of
            which I will tell you.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Abraham got up early in the morning and
            saddled his
            donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split wood for the burnt offering,
            and set
            out and went to the place of which God had told him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>On the third day Abraham raised his eyes and saw
            the
            place from a distance.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then Abraham said to his young men, &ldquo;Stay
            here with the
            donkey, and I and the boy will go over there; and we will worship and return to you.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering
            and
            laid it on his son Isaac, and he took in his hand the fire and the knife. So the two of them walked on
            together.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said,
            &ldquo;My father!&rdquo;
            And he said, &ldquo;Here I am, my son.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Look, the fire and the wood, but where is
            the
            lamb for the burnt
            offering?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Abraham said, &ldquo;God will <small

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then
            they came
            to the place of which God had told him; and Abraham built the altar there and arranged the wood, and bound
            his son
            Isaac and laid him on the altar, on top of the wood.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And Abraham reached out with his hand and took

            the ram
            and offered it up as a burnt offering in the place of his son.
