    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Abner
    sent messengers to David at his place, saying, &ldquo;Whose is the land? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Good! I will make a covenant with

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Ish-bosheth sent <i class="calibre12">men</i> and

    Israel and to the entire house of Benjamin.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Then Abner
    and twenty men with him came to David at Hebron. And David held a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Abner said to David, &ldquo;Let me set out and go and
    gather
    all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may be king over all that
    your soul desires.&rdquo; So David let Abner go, and he went in peace.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> And behold,
    the servants of David and Joab came from a raid and brought a large amount of plunder with them; but Abner was not
    with David in Hebron, since he had let him go, and he had gone in peace.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived,
    they informed Joab, saying, &ldquo;Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go <i

      his way,</i> and he has gone in peace.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then Joab came to the king and said, &ldquo;What have

    done? Behold, Abner came to you; why then have you let him go, so that he is already gone?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>You know Abner the son of Ner, that he came to gain
    your confidence, and to learn of your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1428-1"

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Joab Murders Abner</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> When Joab left David&rsquo;s presence, he sent messengers
    after
    Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David did not know <i class="calibre12">about it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside
    into the middle of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he struck him in the belly, so that he died on
    account of the blood of his brother Asahel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Afterward, when David heard <i
      class="calibre12">about</i> this, he said, &ldquo;I and my kingdom are innocent before the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>May it turn upon the head of Joab and on all his
    father&rsquo;s house; and may there not be eliminated from the house of Joab someone who suffers a discharge, or has
    leprosy, or <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1429-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because he
    had put their brother Asahel to death in the battle at Gibeon.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Mourns Abner</i></p>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>And they buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised
    his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>And the king sang a song of mourning for Abner and

    bread
    or anything else before the sun goes down.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Now all the people took note <i class="calibre12">of

          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1430-4">t</a></sup></small>pleased all the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>So all the people and all Israel understood on that day
    that it had not been <i class="calibre12">the desire</i> of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Then the king said to his servants, &ldquo;Do you not
    know
    that a leader and a great man has fallen in Israel this day?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>And I am weak today, though anointed king; and these
    men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> repay the evildoer in
    proportion to his evil.&rdquo;
