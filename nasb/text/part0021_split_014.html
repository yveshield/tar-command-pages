  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Evils of Oppression</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then I looked again at all the acts of oppression which were
    being done under the sun. And behold, <i class="calibre12">I saw</i> the tears of the oppressed and <i
      class="calibre12">that</i> they had no one to comfort <i class="calibre12">them;</i> and power was on the side of
    their oppressors, but they had no one to comfort <i class="calibre12">them.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So I congratulated the dead who are already dead, more
    than the living who are still living.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But better <i class="calibre12">off</i> than both of
    them is the one who has never existed, who has never seen the evil activity that is done under the sun.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> I have seen
    that every labor and every skill which is done is <i class="calibre12">the result of</i> rivalry between a person
    and his neighbor. This too is futility and striving after wind.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>The fool folds his hands and consumes his own flesh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>One hand full of rest is better than two fists full of
    labor and striving after wind.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then I looked
    again at futility under the sun.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>There was a man without a <small class="small1"><sup

    there was no end to all his labor. Indeed, his eyes were not satisfied with riches, <i class="calibre12">and he
      never asked,</i> &ldquo;And for whom do I labor and deprive myself of pleasure?&rdquo; This too is futility, and
    it is
    an
    unhappy task.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Two are better
    than one because they have a good return for their labor;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Furthermore, if two lie down together they <small

      class="calibre12">alone?</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And if <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three <i class="calibre12">strands</i> is not quickly torn
    apart.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> A poor yet

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>There is no end to all the people, to all who were
    before them. Even the ones who will come later will not be happy with him; for this too is futility and striving
    after wind.
