    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> However, you
    are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these
    are sons <i class="calibre12">and daughters</i> of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For you have not received a spirit of slavery <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6846-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we
    are children of God,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>and if children, heirs also, heirs of God and fellow
    heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with <i class="calibre12">Him</i> so that we may also be glorified with <i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> For I
    consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy <i class="calibre12">to be</i> compared with the
    glory that is to be revealed to us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>For the eagerly awaiting creation waits for the
    revealing of the sons <i class="calibre12">and daughters</i> of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For the creation was subjected to futility, not
    willingly, but because of Him who subjected <i class="calibre12">it,</i> <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6847-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>that the creation itself also will be set free from its
    slavery to corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For we know that the whole creation groans and suffers
    the pains of childbirth together until now.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And not only <i class="calibre12">that,</i> but also we
    ourselves, having the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, waiting eagerly for <i
      class="calibre12">our</i> adoption as sons <i class="calibre12">and daughters,</i> the redemption of our body.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>For in hope we have been saved, but hope that is seen
    is not hope; for who hopes for what he <i class="calibre12">already</i> sees?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>But if we hope for what we do not see, through
    perseverance we wait eagerly <i class="calibre12">for it.</i>

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Now in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness; for

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>and these whom He predestined, He also called; and
    these whom He called, He also justified; and these whom He justified, He also glorified.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> What then
    shall we say to these things? If God <i class="calibre12">is</i> for us, who <i class="calibre12">is</i> against us?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Who will bring charges against God&rsquo;s elect? God
    is the
    one who justifies;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>who is the one who condemns? Christ Jesus is He who

  <div class="block">&ldquo;F<span class="small1">OR</span> Y<span class="small1">OUR SAKE WE ARE KILLED ALL DAY

  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer
    through Him who loved us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor
    angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing will
