  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to
    see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that
    confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from
    God; this is the <i class="calibre12">spirit</i> of the antichrist, which you have heard is coming, and now it is
    already in the world.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>You are from God, little children, and have overcome
    them; because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>They are from the world, therefore they speak <i
      class="calibre12">as</i> from the world, and the world listens to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>We are from God. The one who knows God listens to us;
    the one who is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Beloved, let&rsquo;s love one another; for love is from God,
    and
    everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>The one who does not love does not know God, because God
    is love.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>By this the love of God was revealed <small

    so that we may live through Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He
    loved us and sent His Son <i class="calibre12">to be</i> the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    for our sins.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one
    another.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God
    remains in us, and His love is perfected in us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>By this we know that we remain in Him and He in us,
    because He has given to us of His Spirit.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the
    Son <i class="calibre12">to be</i> the Savior of the world.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Whoever
    confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he in God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>We have come to know and have believed the love which
    God has <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7300-1" epub:type="noteref"

    remains in God, and God remains in him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have
    confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, we also are in this world.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>There is no fear in love, but perfect love drives out
    fear, because fear <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7300-2" epub:type="noteref"

    perfected in love.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>We love, because He first loved us.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>If someone says, &ldquo;I love God,&rdquo; and <i

    does not love his brother <i class="calibre12">and sister</i> whom he has seen, cannot love God, whom he has not
    seen.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who
    loves God must also love his brother <i class="calibre12">and sister.</i>
