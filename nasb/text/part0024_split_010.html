  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Distresses Foretold</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> also came to
    me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;You shall not take a wife for yourself nor have
    sons or
    daughters in this place.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>For this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    says concerning the sons and daughters born in this place, and concerning their mothers who give birth to them, and
    their fathers who father them in this land:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&ldquo;They will die of deadly diseases, they will not
    be
    mourned or buried; they will be like dung on the surface of the ground. And they will perish by sword and famine,
    and their dead bodies will become food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the earth.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> For this is
    what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;Do not enter a house of mourning, or go to mourn or to
    console
    them; for I have withdrawn My peace from this people,&rdquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">and My</i> favor and compassion.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Both great people and small will die in this land; they
    will not be buried, <i class="calibre12">people</i> will not mourn for them, nor will anyone make cuts on himself or
    have his head shaved for them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small><i class="calibre12">People</i> will not break <i
      class="calibre12">bread</i> in mourning for them, to comfort anyone for the dead, nor give them a cup of
    consolation to drink for anyone&rsquo;s father or mother.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Moreover, you shall not go into a house of feasting to
    sit with them to eat and drink.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For this is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of
    armies, the God of Israel says: &ldquo;Behold, I am going to eliminate from this place, before your eyes and in your
    time,
    the voice of rejoicing and the voice of joy, the voice of the groom and the voice of the bride.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> &ldquo;Now it
    will
    happen that, when you tell this people all these words, they will say to you, &lsquo;For what reason has the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> declared all this great disaster against us? And what is our wrongdoing, or what is our
    sin that we have committed against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then you are to say to them, &lsquo;<i
      class="calibre12">It
      is</i> because your forefathers have abandoned Me,&rsquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    &lsquo;and have
    followed other gods, and served and worshiped them; but they have abandoned Me and have not kept My Law.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>You too have done evil, <i class="calibre12">even</i>
    more than your forefathers; for behold, each one of you is following the stubbornness of his own evil heart, without
    listening to Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So I will hurl you off this land to the land which you
    have not known, <i class="calibre12">neither</i> you nor your fathers; and there you will serve other gods day and
    night, because I will show you no compassion.&rsquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">God Will Restore Them</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> &ldquo;Therefore behold, days are coming,&rdquo; declares the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, &ldquo;when it will no longer be said, &lsquo;As the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>
    lives, who
    brought up the sons of Israel out of the land of Egypt,&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>but, &lsquo;As the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    lives,
    who brought up the sons of Israel from the land of the north and from all the lands where He had banished
    them.&rsquo; For
    I will restore them to their own land which I gave to their fathers.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span>
    &ldquo;Behold, I am
    going to send for many fishermen,&rdquo; declares the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, &ldquo;and they will fish
    for
    them; and
    afterward I will send for many hunters, and they will hunt them from every mountain and every hill and from the
    clefts of the rocks.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For My eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden
    from My face, nor is their wrongdoing concealed from My eyes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>I will first repay them double for their wrongdoing and
    their sin, because they have defiled My land; they have filled My inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable
    idols and their abominations.&rdquo;
