  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel&rsquo;s Labor Increased</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> And afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh,
    &ldquo;This
    is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel says: &lsquo;Let My people go so that they may
    celebrate a
    feast to Me in the wilderness.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Who is the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and besides, I will not let Israel go.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then they said, &ldquo;The God of the Hebrews has met
    with us.
    Please, let us go a three days&rsquo; journey into the wilderness so that we may sacrifice to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> our God, otherwise He will strike us with plague or with the sword.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But the king of Egypt said to them, &ldquo;Moses and
    Aaron,
    why do you let the people neglect their <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source281-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_000.html#f281-1">a</a></sup></small>work? Get <i
      class="calibre12">back</i> to your labors!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Again Pharaoh said, &ldquo;Look, the people of the land
    are
    now many, and you would have them cease from their labors!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters over
    the people and their foremen, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>&ldquo;You are no longer to give the people straw to
    make
    bricks as previously; have them go and gather straw for themselves.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>But you shall impose on them the quota of bricks which
    they were making before; you are not to reduce any of it. Because they are lazy, for that reason they cry <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source281-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f281-2">b</a></sup></small>out, &lsquo;Let us go and sacrifice to our
    God.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Let the labor be heavier on the men, and have them work
    at it so that they will pay no attention to false words.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So the
    taskmasters of the people and their foremen went out and spoke to the people, saying, &ldquo;This is what Pharaoh
    says: &lsquo;I
    am not going to give you <i class="calibre12">any</i> straw.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>You go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find
    <i class="calibre12">it;</i> but none of your labor will be reduced.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So the people scattered through all the land of Egypt
    to gather stubble for straw.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And the taskmasters pressed them, saying,
    &ldquo;Complete
    your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source282-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f282-1">c</a></sup></small>work quota, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source282-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f282-2">d</a></sup></small><i class="calibre12">your</i> daily amount, just as
    when <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source282-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f282-3">e</a></sup></small>you had straw.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Moreover, the foremen of the sons of Israel, whom
    Pharaoh&rsquo;s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source282-4" epub:type="noteref" href="part0005_split_000.html#f282-4">f</a></sup></small>and asked,
    &ldquo;Why
    have you not completed your required task of making bricks either yesterday or today, as before?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then the
    foremen of the sons of Israel came and cried out to Pharaoh, saying, &ldquo;Why do you deal this way with your
    servants?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>There is no straw given to your servants, yet they keep
    saying to us, &lsquo;Make bricks!&rsquo; And behold, your servants are being beaten; but it is the fault of your <i
      class="calibre12">own</i> people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But he said, &ldquo;You are lazy, <i
      class="calibre12">very</i> lazy; for that reason you say, &lsquo;Let us go <i class="calibre12">and</i> sacrifice
    to the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So go now <i class="calibre12">and</i> work; for you
    will be given no straw, but you must deliver the quota of bricks.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>The foremen of the sons of Israel saw that they were in
    trouble, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source283-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f283-1">g</a></sup></small>since they were told, &ldquo;You must not reduce
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source283-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f283-2">h</a></sup></small>your daily amount of bricks.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>When they left Pharaoh&rsquo;s presence, they met Moses
    and
    Aaron as they were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source283-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f283-3">i</a></sup></small>waiting for them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And they said to them, &ldquo;May the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> look upon you and judge <i class="calibre12">you,</i> because you have made <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source283-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_000.html#f283-4">j</a></sup></small>us repulsive in Pharaoh&rsquo;s sight and in the
    sight of
    his servants, to put a sword in their hand to kill us!&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Then Moses
    returned to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and said, &ldquo;Lord, why have You brought harm to this people?
    Why did
    You ever send me?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he
    has done harm to this people, and You have not rescued Your people at all.&rdquo;
