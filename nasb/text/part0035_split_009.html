    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now I make known to you, brothers <i class="calibre12">and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>by which you also are saved, if you hold firmly to

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> For I handed
    down to you <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6950-1" epub:type="noteref"

    Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the
    third day according to the Scriptures,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>and that He appeared to <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>After that He appeared to more than five hundred
    brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters</i> at one time, most of whom remain until now, but some have fallen

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>then He appeared to <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6950-5">f</a></sup></small>and not fit to be called an apostle, because I
    persecuted the church of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace
    toward me did not prove vain; but I labored even more than all of them, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Whether then <i class="calibre12">it was</i> I or they,
    so we preach and so you believed.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now if Christ
    is preached, that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the
    dead?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not
    even Christ has been raised;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>and if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching
    is in vain, your faith also is in vain.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Moreover, we are even found <i class="calibre12">to
      be</i> false witnesses of God, because we testified <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    are not raised.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>For if the dead are not raised, then not even Christ
    has been raised;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is
    worthless; you are still in your sins.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have
    perished.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>If we have hoped in Christ only in this life, we are of
    all people most to be pitied.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Order of Resurrection</i></p>

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> But the fact is, Christ has been raised from the dead, the
    first fruits of those who are asleep.

    authority and power.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>For He must reign until He has put all His enemies
    under His feet.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>For H<span class="small1">E HAS PUT ALL THINGS IN

    Himself will also be subjected to the One who subjected all things to Him, so that God may be all in all.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">29</b></span> For

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">35</b></span> But someone
    will say, &ldquo;How are the dead raised? And with what kind of body do they come?&rdquo;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>But God gives it a body just as He wished, and to each

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one <i

    the glory of the heavenly is one, and the <i class="calibre12">glory</i> of the earthly is another.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the
    moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">42</b></span> So also is
    the resurrection of the dead. It is sown <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6955-1"
