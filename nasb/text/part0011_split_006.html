  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then David&rsquo;s anger burned greatly against the man,

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Nathan then

    &lsquo;It is I who anointed you as king over Israel, and it is I who rescued you from the hand of Saul.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now then, the sword shall never leave your house,
    because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says:
    &lsquo;Behold, I am going to raise up evil against you from your own household; I will even take your wives before

    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo; And Nathan said to David, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> also
    has
    allowed
    your sin to pass; you shall not die.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>However, since by this deed you have shown utter

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>David therefore pleaded with God for the child; and
    David fasted and went and lay all night on the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>The elders of his household stood beside him in order
    to help him up from the ground, but he was unwilling and would not eat food with them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then it happened on the seventh day that the child
    died. And David&rsquo;s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, &ldquo;Behold,
    while the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>But when David saw that his servants were whispering
    together, David perceived that the child was dead; so David said to his servants, &ldquo;Is the child dead?&rdquo;
    And
    they
    said, &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So David got up from the ground, washed, anointed <i
      class="calibre12">himself,</i> and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and worshiped. Then he went to his own house, and when he asked, they served him food,
    and he ate.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then his
    servants said to him, &ldquo;What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child <i

    you got up and ate food.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;While the child was still alive, I
    fasted
    and wept; for I said, &lsquo;Who knows, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> may be gracious to me, and the child
    may
    live.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But now he has died; why should I fast? Can I bring him
    back again? I am going to him, but he will not return to me.&rdquo;
