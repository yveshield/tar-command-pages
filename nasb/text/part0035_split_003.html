    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our
    Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>If I am not an apostle to others, at least I am to you;
    for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> My defense to
    those who examine me is this:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6924-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_010.html#f6924-1">a</a></sup></small>Do we not have

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Or do only <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6924-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6924-5">e</a></sup></small>Barnabas and I have no right to refrain from <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6924-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6924-6">f</a></sup></small>working?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense?
    Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who tends a flock and does not <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6924-7" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6924-7">g</a></sup></small>consume some of the milk of the flock?

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> I am not <i
      class="calibre12">just</i> asserting these things according to human judgment, am I? Or does the Law not say these
    things as well?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For it is written in the Law of Moses: &ldquo;Y<span
      class="small1">OU SHALL NOT MUZZLE THE OX WHILE IT IS THRESHING</span>.&rdquo; God is not concerned about oxen, is
    He?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Or is He speaking entirely for our sake? Yes, it was
    written for our sake, because the plowman ought to plow in hope, and the thresher <i class="calibre12">to thresh</i>
    in hope of sharing <i class="calibre12">in the crops.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>If we sowed spiritual things in you, is it too much if
    we reap material things from you?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>If others share the right over you, do we not more?
    Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause no hindrance to the gospel
    of Christ.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Do you not know that those who perform sacred services
    eat <i class="calibre12">the food</i> of the temple, <i class="calibre12">and</i> those who attend regularly to the
    altar have their share <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6925-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6925-1">h</a></sup></small>from the altar?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So also the Lord directed those who proclaim the gospel
    to get their living from the gospel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> But I have
    used none of these things. And I have not written these things so that it will be done so in my case; for it would
    be better for me to die than <i class="calibre12">that.</i> No one shall make my boast an empty one!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast <i
      class="calibre12">about,</i> for I am under compulsion; for woe to me if I do not preach the gospel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For if I do this voluntarily, I have a reward; but if
    against my will, I have been entrusted with a commission <i class="calibre12">nonetheless.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>What, then, is my reward? That, when I preach the
    gospel, I may offer the gospel without charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> For though I
    am free from all people, I have made myself a slave to all, so that I may gain more.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>To the Jews I became as a Jew, so that I might gain
    Jews; to those who are under the Law, <i class="calibre12">I became</i> as <i class="calibre12">one</i> under the
    Law, though not being under the Law myself, so that I might gain those who are under the Law;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>to those who are without the Law, <i
      class="calibre12">I became</i> as one without the Law, though not being without the law of God but under the law
    of Christ, so that I might gain those who are without the Law.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>To the weak I became weak, that I might gain the weak;
    I have become all things to all people, so that I may by all means save some.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>I do all things for the sake of the gospel, so that I
    may become a fellow partaker of it.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Do you not
    know that those who run in a race all run, but <i class="calibre12">only</i> one receives the prize? Run in such a
    way that you may win.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Everyone who competes in the games exercises
    self-control in all things. So they <i class="calibre12">do it</i> to obtain a perishable wreath, but we an
    imperishable.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Therefore I run in such a way as not <i
      class="calibre12">to run</i> aimlessly; I box in such a way, as <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6926-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_010.html#f6926-1">i</a></sup></small>to avoid
    hitting air;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>but I strictly discipline my body and make it my slave,
    so that, after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified.
