  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Samuel Addresses Israel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Samuel said to all Israel, &ldquo;Behold, I have listened
    to
    your voice for all that you said to me, and I have appointed a king over you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Now, here is the king walking before you, but as for me,
    I am old and gray, and my sons are here with you. And I have walked before you since my youth to this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Here I am; testify against me before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and His anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I
    exploited? Whom have I oppressed, or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to close my eyes with it? I will return <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And they said, &ldquo;You have not exploited us or
    oppressed
    us, or taken anything from anyone&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So he said to them, &ldquo;The L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> is witness against you, and His anointed is witness this day that you have found nothing
    in my hand.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">He is</i> witness.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then Samuel
    said to the people, &ldquo;It is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> who <small class="small1"><sup

    Moses and Aaron and who brought your fathers up from the land of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now then, take your stand, so that I may enter into
    judgment with you before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> concerning all the righteous acts of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> that He did for you and your fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>When Jacob went into Egypt and your fathers cried out to
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent Moses and Aaron <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1309-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1309-2">b</a></sup></small>who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled
    them in this place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But they forgot the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    their God, so He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of the army of Hazor, and into the hand of the
    Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab, and they fought against them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>They cried out to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    and said, &lsquo;We have sinned, because we have abandoned the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and have served the
    Baals
    and the Ashtaroth; but now save us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent
    Jerubbaal, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1309-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1309-3">c</a></sup></small>Bedan, Jephthah, and Samuel, and saved you from the
    hands of your enemies all around, so that you lived in security.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The King Confirmed</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But when you saw that Nahash the king of the sons of
    Ammon was coming against you, you said to me, &lsquo;No, but a king shall reign over us!&rsquo; Yet the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God <i class="calibre12">was</i> your king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And now, behold, the king whom you have chosen, whom
    you have asked for, and behold, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>If you will fear the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    and serve Him, and listen to His voice and not rebel against the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1310-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1310-2">e</a></sup></small>command of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, then both you and the king who reigns over you will follow the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>But if you do not listen to the voice of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, but rebel against the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1310-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1310-3">f</a></sup></small>command of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, then the hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will be against you, even <i
      class="calibre12">as it was</i> against your fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Even now, take your stand and see this great thing
    which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is going to do before your eyes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call to the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, that He will send <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1310-4" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1310-4">g</a></sup></small>thunder and
    rain. Then you will know and see that your wickedness is great which you have done in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, by asking for yourselves a king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So Samuel called to the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1310-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1310-5">h</a></sup></small>thunder and rain that day; and all the people
    greatly feared the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and Samuel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Then all the
    people said to Samuel, &ldquo;Pray to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God for your servants, so that we do
    not
    die; for we have added to all our sins <i class="calibre12">this</i> evil, by asking for ourselves a king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Samuel said to the people, &ldquo;Do not fear. You have
    committed all this evil, yet do not turn aside from following the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, but serve the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with all your heart.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Indeed, you must not turn aside, for <i
      class="calibre12">then you would go</i> after useless things which cannot benefit or save, because they are
    useless.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will not
    abandon His people on account of His great name, because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has been pleased to
    make you a people for Himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Furthermore, as for me, far be it from me that I would
    sin against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and
    right way.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Only <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1311-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1311-1">i</a></sup></small>fear the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and serve Him in truth with all your heart; for consider what great things He has
    done for you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>But if you still do evil, both you and your king will
    be swept away.&rdquo;
