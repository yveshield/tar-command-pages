            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it was after this that Absalom the son of David
            had a
            beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon the son of David was in love with her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But Amnon was so frustrated on account of his
            sister
            Tamar that he made himself ill, for she was a virgin, and it <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            difficult to Amnon to do anything to her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab,

            and
            Jonadab was a very
            clever man.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And he said to him, &ldquo;Why are you, the
            king&rsquo;s son, so
            depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?&rdquo; So Amnon said to him, &ldquo;I am in love with
            Tamar, the sister
            of my brother Absalom.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Jonadab then said to him, &ldquo;Lie down on

            and give

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Amnon lay down and pretended to be ill; when
            the king
            came to see him, Amnon said to the king, &ldquo;Please have my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of
            pastries in my
            sight, so that I may eat from her hand.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then
            David

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon&rsquo;s
            house, and
            he was
            lying <i class="calibre12">in bed.</i> And she took dough, kneaded <i class="calibre12">it,</i> made
            pastries in his
            sight, and baked the pastries.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then she took the tray and served <i
                  class="calibre12">them</i> to him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, &ldquo;Have everyone leave
            me.&rdquo; So everyone
            left him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Amnon said to Tamar, &ldquo;Bring the food

            your hand.&rdquo; So Tamar
            took the pastries which she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her brother Amnon.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>When she brought <i class="calibre12">them</i>
            to him
            to eat, he took hold of her and said to her, &ldquo;Come, sleep with me, my sister.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But she said to him, &ldquo;No, my brother, do

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>As for me, where could I <small

            please speak to the king,

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>However, he would not listen to <small

                              href="part0011_split_018.html#f1473-6">i</a></sup></small>her; since he was stronger than
            she, he violated her
            and slept with her.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then
            Amnon
            hated her with a very great hatred; indeed, the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love
            with which
            he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, &ldquo;Get up, go <i class="calibre12">away!</i>&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But she said to him, &ldquo;No, because this
            wrong in sending
            me away is greater than the other that you have done to me!&rdquo; Yet he would not listen to her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then he called his young man who attended him
            and said,
            &ldquo;Now throw this woman out of my <i class="calibre12">presence,</i> and lock the door behind
            her!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now she had on a <small class="small1"><sup

            is how the virgin
            daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then his attendant took her out and locked the door
            behind her.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Tamar took ashes <i class="calibre12">and put
                  them</i>
            on her head, and tore her <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1474-2"

            garment which <i class="calibre12">was</i> on her; and she put her hand on her head and went <i

            crying out as she went.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Then
            Absalom
            her brother said to her, &ldquo;Has Amnon your brother been with you? But now keep silent, my sister, he is
            your brother;
            do not take this matter to heart.&rdquo; So Tamar remained and was isolated in her brother Absalom&rsquo;s
            house.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Now when King David heard about all these
            matters, he
            became very angry.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But Absalom did not speak with Amnon either
            good or
            bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now
            it came
            about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers in Baal-hazor, which is near Ephraim, and Absalom
            invited
            all the king&rsquo;s sons <i class="calibre12">to celebrate.</i>

      <p class="aleft">
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And Absalom came to the king and said,
            &ldquo;Behold now,
            your servant has sheepshearers; may the king and his servants please go with your servant.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>But the king said to Absalom, &ldquo;No, my
            son, we should
            not all go, so that we will not be a burden to you.&rdquo; Though he urged him, he would not go; but he
            blessed
            him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then Absalom said, &ldquo;If not, please have
            my brother
            Amnon go with us.&rdquo; But the king said to him, &ldquo;Why should he go with you?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Nevertheless Absalom urged him, so he let Amnon
            and all
            the king&rsquo;s sons go with him.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Then
            Absalom
            commanded his servants, saying, &ldquo;See now, when Amnon&rsquo;s heart is cheerful with wine, and I say to
            you,
            &lsquo;Strike
            Amnon,&rsquo; then put him to death. Do not fear; have I not commanded you myself? Be courageous and be

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just
            as
            Absalom had commanded. Then all the king&rsquo;s sons got up and each mounted his mule and fled.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Now
            it was
            while they were on the way that the report came to David, saying, &ldquo;Absalom has struck and killed all

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Then the king stood up, tore his clothes, and
