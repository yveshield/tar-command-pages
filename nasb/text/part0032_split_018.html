    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> After these things Jesus went away to the other side of the
    Sea of Galilee (<i class="calibre12">or</i> Tiberias).
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>A large crowd was following Him, because they were
    watching the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6548-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6548-1">a</a></sup></small>signs which He was performing on those who were
    sick.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat with
    His disciples.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So Jesus, after raising His eyes and seeing that a large
    crowd was coming to Him, *said to Philip, &ldquo;Where are we to buy bread so that these <i
      class="calibre12">people</i>
    may eat?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But He was saying this <i class="calibre12">only</i> to
    test him, for He Himself knew what He intended to do.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Philip answered Him, &ldquo;Two hundred <small

    each to receive <i class="calibre12">just</i> a little!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s
    brother,
    *said to Him,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>&ldquo;There is a boy here who has five barley loaves
    and two
    fish; but what are these for so many <i class="calibre12">people?</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Jesus said, &ldquo;Have the people recline <i
      class="calibre12">to eat.</i>&rdquo; Now there was plenty of grass in the place. So the men reclined, about <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6548-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6548-3">c</a></sup></small>five thousand in number.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Jesus then took the loaves, and after giving thanks He
    distributed <i class="calibre12">them</i> to those who were reclining; likewise also of the fish, as much as they
    wanted.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And when they had eaten their fill, He *said to His
    disciples, &ldquo;Gather up the leftover pieces so that nothing will be lost.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So they gathered them up, and filled twelve baskets
    with pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Therefore when the people saw the <small

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6548-4">d</a></sup></small>sign which He had performed, they said, &ldquo;This
    is
    truly the Prophet who is to come into the world.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus Walks on the Water</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> So Jesus, aware that they <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6549-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6549-1">e</a></sup></small>intended to come and take Him by force to make Him
    king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself, alone.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Now when
    evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>and after getting into a boat, they <i
      class="calibre12">started to</i> cross the sea to Capernaum. It had already become dark, and Jesus had not yet
    come to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>In addition, the sea <i class="calibre12">began</i>
    getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then, when they had rowed about <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6550-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6550-1">f</a></sup></small>twenty-five or thirty stadia, they *saw Jesus
    walking on the sea and coming near the boat; and they were frightened.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>But He *said to them, &ldquo;It is I; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6550-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6550-2">g</a></sup></small>do not be afraid.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>So they were willing to take Him into the boat, and
    immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> The next day
    the crowd that stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other small boat there except one, and that
    Jesus had not gotten into the boat with His disciples, but <i class="calibre12">that</i> His disciples had departed
    alone.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Other small boats came from Tiberias near to the place
    where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>So when the crowd saw that Jesus was not there, nor His
    disciples, they themselves got into the small boats and came to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And when they found Him on the other side of the sea,
    they said to Him, &ldquo;Rabbi, when did You get here?&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Words to the People</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to

    of the loaves and were filled.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the
    food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, for on Him the Father, God, has set His <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Therefore they said to Him, &ldquo;What are we to do,
    so that
    we may accomplish the works of God?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;This is the
    work of
    God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So they said to Him, &ldquo;What then are You doing as
    a
    sign, so that we may see, and believe You? What work are You performing?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is
    written: &lsquo;H<span class="small1">E GAVE THEM BREAD OUT OF HEAVEN TO EAT</span>.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Jesus then said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to
    you,
    it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is My Father who gives you the true bread out of
    heaven.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>For the bread of God is <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6551-3" epub:type="noteref"

    to the world.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Then they said to Him, &ldquo;Lord, always give us this
    bread.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">35</b></span> Jesus said to
    them, &ldquo;I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will
    never
    be thirsty.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>But I said to you that you have indeed seen Me, and <i
      class="calibre12">yet</i> you do not believe.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me,
    and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own
    will, but the will of Him who sent Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that of
    everything that He has given Me I will lose nothing, but will raise it up on the last day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>For this is the will of My Father, that everyone who
    sees the Son and believes in Him will have eternal life, and I Myself will raise him up on the last day.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Words to the Jews</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">41</b></span> So then the Jews were complaining about Him because He said,
    &ldquo;I am the bread that came down out of heaven.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>And they were saying, &ldquo;Is this not Jesus, the son
    of
    Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does He now say, &lsquo;I have come down out of heaven&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">43</sup></small>Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Stop
    complaining
    among yourselves.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me
    draws him; and I will raise him up on the last day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">45</sup></small>It is written in the Prophets: &lsquo;A<span

    Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father, comes to Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">46</sup></small>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the One who
    is from God; He has seen the Father.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">47</sup></small>Truly, truly, I say to you, the one who believes has
    eternal life.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">48</sup></small>I am the bread of life.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">49</sup></small>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they
    died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>This is the bread that comes down out of heaven, so
    that anyone may eat from it and not die.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>I am the living bread that came down out of heaven; if
    anyone eats from this bread, he will live forever; and the bread which I will give for the life of the world also is
    My flesh.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">52</b></span> Then the Jews
    <i class="calibre12">began</i> to argue with one another, saying, &ldquo;How can this man give us His flesh to
    eat?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>So Jesus said to them, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to
    you,
    unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">54</sup></small>The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has
    eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">55</sup></small>For My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">56</sup></small>The one who eats My flesh and drinks My blood remains
    in Me, and I in him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">57</sup></small>Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because
    of the Father, the one who eats Me, he also will live because of Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">58</sup></small>This is the bread that came down out of heaven, not as
    the fathers ate and died; the one who eats this bread will live forever.&rdquo;
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Words to the Disciples</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">59</sup></small>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">60</b></span> So then many
    of His disciples, when they heard <i class="calibre12">this,</i> said, &ldquo;This statement is <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">64</sup></small>But there are some of you who do not believe.&rdquo;
    For
    Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who it was who would <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">65</sup></small>And He was saying, &ldquo;For this reason I have told
