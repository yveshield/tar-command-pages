  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jonathan&rsquo;s Victory</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the day came that Jonathan, the son of Saul, said to the
    young man who was carrying his armor, &ldquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s cross over to the Philistines&rsquo; garrison
    that is on the
    other
    side.&rdquo; But he did not tell his father.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Saul was staying on the outskirts of Gibeah under the
    pomegranate tree that is in Migron. And the people who <i class="calibre12">were</i> with him <i
      class="calibre12">numbered</i> about six hundred men;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod&rsquo;s brother,
    the
    son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the priest of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> at Shiloh, was <small

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1317-1">a</a></sup></small>wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that
    Jonathan had gone.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now between the gorges by which Jonathan sought to cross
    over to the Philistines&rsquo; garrison there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side;
    and
    the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other, Seneh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>The one crag <i class="calibre12">rose</i> on the north
    opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then Jonathan
    said to the young man who was carrying his armor, &ldquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s cross over to the garrison of these
    uncircumcised
    <i class="calibre12">men;</i> perhaps the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will work for us, because the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> is not limited to saving by many or by few!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>His armor bearer said to him, &ldquo;Do everything that
    is in
    your heart; turn yourself <i class="calibre12">to it, and</i> here I am with you, as your heart <i
      class="calibre12">desires.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Jonathan said, &ldquo;Behold, we are going to cross
    over
    to the men and reveal ourselves to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>If they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    &lsquo;Wait until we come to you&rsquo;; then we will stand in our place and not go up to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But if they <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1318-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1318-2">c</a></sup></small>say, &lsquo;Come up to us,&rsquo; then we will go
    up, for
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has handed them over to us; and this <i class="calibre12">shall be</i> the sign to
    us.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>When the two of them revealed themselves to the
    garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, &ldquo;Behold, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they
    have kept
    themselves hidden.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and
    his armor bearer and said, &ldquo;Come up to us and we will inform you of something.&rdquo; And Jonathan said to his
    armor
    bearer, &ldquo;Come up after me, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has handed them over to Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, with
    his armor bearer behind him; and <i class="calibre12">the men</i> fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer put
    some to death after him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Now that first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor
    bearer inflicted was about twenty men within about half a furrow in an acre of land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field,
    and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders trembled, and the earth quaked so that it became a

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1318-3">d</a></sup></small>great trembling.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Now
    Saul&rsquo;s
    watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude dissolved; they went here <i class="calibre12">and
      there.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So Saul said to the people who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> with him, &ldquo;Look carefully now and see who has left us.&rdquo; And when they had
    looked,
    behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were not <i class="calibre12">there.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then Saul said to Ahijah, &ldquo;Bring the ark of God
    here.&rdquo;
    For at that time the ark of God was with the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the
    camp of the Philistines continued and increased; so Saul said to the priest, &ldquo;Withdraw your hand.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then Saul and all the people who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> with him rallied and came to the battle; and behold, every man&rsquo;s sword was
    against his
    fellow <i class="calibre12">Philistine, and there was</i> very great confusion.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Now the Hebrews <i class="calibre12">who</i> were with
    the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, even they also <i
      class="calibre12">returned</i> to be with the Israelites who <i class="calibre12">were</i> with Saul and Jonathan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>When all the men of Israel who had kept themselves
    hidden in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they also closely pursued them in the
    battle.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> saved Israel
    that day, and the battle <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1319-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1319-1">e</a></sup></small>spread beyond Beth-aven.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Saul&rsquo;s Foolish Order</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Now the men of Israel were hard-pressed on that day, for Saul
    had put the people under oath, saying, &ldquo;Cursed be the man who eats food <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1320-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1320-1">f</a></sup></small>before evening, and <i class="calibre12">before</i>
    I have avenged myself on my enemies.&rdquo; So none of the people tasted food.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>All <i class="calibre12">the people of</i> the land
    entered the forest, and there was honey on the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>When the people entered the forest, behold, <i
      class="calibre12">there was</i> honey dripping; but no man put his hand to his mouth, because the people feared
    the oath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>However, Jonathan had not heard <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> when his father put the people under oath; so he put out the end of the staff that <i
      class="calibre12">was</i> in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth, and his eyes
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1320-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1320-2">g</a></sup></small>brightened.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Then one of the people responded and said, &ldquo;Your
    father
    strictly put the people under oath, saying, &lsquo;Cursed be the man who eats food today.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; And
    the
    people
    were
    weary.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Then Jonathan said, &ldquo;My father has troubled the
    land.
    See now that my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>How much more, if only the people had freely eaten
    today of the spoils of their enemies which they found! For now the defeat among the Philistines has not been
    great.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> They attacked
    the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. But the people were very tired.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>So the people loudly rushed upon the spoils, and took
    sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered <i class="calibre12">them</i> on the ground; and the people ate <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> with the blood.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Then <i class="calibre12">observers</i> informed Saul,
    saying, &ldquo;Look, the people are sinning against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by eating <i
      class="calibre12">meat</i> with the blood.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;You have acted treacherously; roll a large
    rock to
    me
    today.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Then Saul said, &ldquo;Disperse yourselves among the
    people
    and say to them, &lsquo;Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and slaughter <i class="calibre12">it</i> here
    and
    eat; and do not sin against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by eating <i class="calibre12">it</i> with the
    blood.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; So all the people brought <i class="calibre12">them</i> that night, each one his ox
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1321-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1321-1">h</a></sup></small>with him, and they slaughtered <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>And Saul built an altar to the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">36</b></span> Then Saul
    said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down after the Philistines by night and take plunder among them until the morning light,
    and
    let&rsquo;s
    not leave a man among them alive.&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Do whatever seems good <small class="small1"><sup

    &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
    approach
    God
    here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>So Saul inquired of God: &ldquo;Shall I go down after
    the
    Philistines? Will You hand them over to Israel?&rdquo; But He did not answer him on that day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Then Saul said, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>For as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, who
    saves Israel, even if it is in my son Jonathan, he shall assuredly die!&rdquo; But not one of all the people
    answered him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>Then he said to all Israel, &ldquo;You shall be on one
    side,
    and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.&rdquo; And the people said to Saul, &ldquo;Do what seems good

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">43</b></span> So Saul said
    to Jonathan, &ldquo;Tell me what you have done.&rdquo; And Jonathan told him, and said, &ldquo;I did indeed taste a
