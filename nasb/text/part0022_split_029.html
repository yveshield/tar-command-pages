    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib king
    of Assyria marched against all the fortified cities of Judah and seized them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
    Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a large army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the road to the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> And Rabshakeh
    said to them, &ldquo;Say now to Hezekiah, &lsquo;This is what the great king, the king of Assyria says: &ldquo;What

    that you
    have revolted against me?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Behold, you have relied on the staff of this broken
    reed, on Egypt, on which if a man leans, it will go into his <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    and
    has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, &lsquo;You shall worship before this altar&rsquo;?

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But Rabshakeh said, &ldquo;Has my master sent me <i

    men who sit on the wall, <i class="calibre12">doomed</i> to eat their own dung and drink their own urine with
    you?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then
    Rabshakeh stood and called out with a loud voice in Judean and said, &ldquo;Hear the words of the great king, the
    king of
    Assyria!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>This is what the king says: &lsquo;Do not let Hezekiah
    deceive you, for he will not be able to save you;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>and do not let Hezekiah lead you to rely on the L<span

    will
    not be handed over to the king of Assyria!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Do not listen to Hezekiah,&rsquo; for this is what the
    king
    of Assyria says: &lsquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4551-1" epub:type="noteref"

    one, of his vine and each of his fig tree, and each drink of the waters of his own cistern,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>until I come and take you away to a land like your own
    land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

    mislead you, saying, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will save us.&rdquo; Has any one of the gods of the

    saved his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> But they were
    silent and did not answer him <i class="calibre12">so much as</i> a word; for the king&rsquo;s command was,

    him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Eliakim the son of Hilkiah, who was over the
    household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph, the secretary, came to Hezekiah with their clothes
    torn, and reported to him the words of Rabshakeh.
