            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Again, there was a day when the sons of God came to
            present
            themselves before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

            came among them to present himself before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
            Satan,
            &ldquo;Where have you come from?&rdquo; Then Satan answered the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and said,
            &ldquo;From roaming about
            on the earth and walking around on it.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
            Satan,
            &ldquo;Have you <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2283-2" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0017_split_010.html#f2283-2">b</a></sup></small>considered My servant Job? For
            there is no one like
            him on the earth, a blameless and upright man <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
                              id="source2283-3" epub:type="noteref"

            from evil. And he still holds firm to his integrity, although you incited Me against him to <small

                              href="part0017_split_010.html#f2283-4">d</a></sup></small>ruin him without cause.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Satan answered the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> and
            said, &ldquo;Skin for skin! Yes, all that a man has, he will give for his life.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>However, reach out with Your hand now, and touch
            his
            bone and his flesh; he will curse You to Your face!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to
            Satan,
            &ldquo;Behold, he is in your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2283-5"

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then
            Satan
            went out from the presence of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and struck Job with severe boils from the
            sole of
            his foot to the top of his head.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">Job</i> took a piece of
            pottery
            to scrape himself while he was sitting in the ashes.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then
            his wife
            said to him, &ldquo;Do you still hold firm your integrity? Curse God and die!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But he said to her, &ldquo;You are speaking as
            one of the
            foolish women speaks. Shall we actually accept good from God but not accept adversity?&rdquo; Despite all
            this,
            Job did
            not sin with his lips.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now
            when
            Job&rsquo;s three friends heard about all this adversity that had come upon him, they came, each one from
            his own
            placeâ€”Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite; and they made an appointment
            together to
            come to sympathize with him and comfort him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>When they <small class="small1"><sup
                        class="calibre14"><a id="source2284-1" epub:type="noteref"

            not recognize him,
            they raised their voices and wept. And each of them tore his robe, and they threw dust over their heads
            toward the
            sky.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then they sat down on the ground with him for
            seven
            days and seven nights, with no one speaking a word to him, for they saw that <i class="calibre12">his</i>
            pain was
            very great.
