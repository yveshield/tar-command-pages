    the firstborn, but because he defiled his father&rsquo;s bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph, the
    son of
    Israel; so he is not enrolled in the genealogy according to the birthright.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Though Judah prevailed over his brothers, and from him
    <i class="calibre12">came</i> the leader, yet the birthright belonged to Joseph),

    their generations, <i class="calibre12">were</i> Jeiel the chief, then Zechariah
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>and Bela, the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of
    Joel, who lived in Aroer, as far as Nebo and Baal-meon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Toward the east he settled as far as the entrance of the
    wilderness from the river Euphrates, because their livestock had increased in the land of Gilead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>In the days of Saul they made war with the Hagrites,
    who fell by their hand, so that they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1861-2"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Joel <i class="calibre12">was</i> the head and Shapham
    the second, then Janai and Shaphat in Bashan.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Their relatives of their fathers&rsquo; households <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>All of these were enrolled in the genealogies in the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> The sons of
    Reuben, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, <i class="calibre12">consisting</i> of valiant men, men who
    carried shield and sword and shot with a bow and <i class="calibre12">were</i> skillful in battle, <i
      class="calibre12">totaled</i> 44,760 who went to war.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>They made war against the Hagrites, Jetur, Naphish, and
    Nodab.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>They were helped against them, and the Hagrites and all
    who <i class="calibre12">were</i> with them were handed over to them; for they cried out to God in the battle, and
    He answered their prayers because they trusted in Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>They took away their livestock: their fifty thousand
    camels, 250,000 sheep, <i class="calibre12">and</i> two thousand donkeys; and a hundred thousand <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For many fell mortally wounded, because the war <i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Now the sons
    of the half-tribe of Manasseh lived in the land; from Bashan to Baal-hermon, Senir, and Mount Hermon they were
    numerous.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>These were the heads of their fathers&rsquo;
    households:
    Epher, Ishi, Eliel, Azriel, Jeremiah, Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, valiant mighty men, famous men, heads of their
    fathers&rsquo;
    households.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> But they were
    untrue to the God of their fathers and prostituted themselves with the gods of the peoples of the land, whom God had
    destroyed before them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>So the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul, king
    of Assyria, that is, the spirit of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1864-1"

    Assyria, and he took them into exile, namely the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, and
    brought them to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the river of Gozan, <i class="calibre12">where they are</i> to this day.
