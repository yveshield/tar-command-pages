  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then it happened <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1458-1">a</a></sup></small>in the spring, at the time when kings go out <i
      class="calibre12">to battle,</i> that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all Israel, and they brought
    destruction on the sons of Ammon and besieged Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> Now at evening
    time David got up from his bed and walked around on the roof of the king&rsquo;s house, and from the roof he saw a
    woman
    bathing; and the woman was very beautiful in appearance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So David sent <i class="calibre12">servants</i> and
    inquired about the woman. And <i class="calibre12">someone</i> said, &ldquo;Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of
    Eliam,
    the wife of Uriah the Hittite?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then David sent messengers and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1459-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1459-1">b</a></sup></small>had her brought, and when she came to him, he slept
    with her; and when she had purified herself from her uncleanness, she returned to her house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>But the woman conceived; so she sent <i
      class="calibre12">word</i> and informed David, and said, &ldquo;I am pregnant.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then David
    sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> to Joab: &ldquo;Send me Uriah the Hittite.&rdquo; So Joab sent Uriah to David.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When Uriah came to him, David asked about Joab&rsquo;s
    well-being and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1460-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1460-1">c</a></sup></small>that of the people, and the condition of the war.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Go down to your house,
    and
    wash your feet.&rdquo; So Uriah left the king&rsquo;s house, and a gift from the king <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1460-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1460-2">d</a></sup></small>was sent after him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But Uriah slept at the door of the king&rsquo;s house
    with all
    the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now when they informed David, saying, &ldquo;Uriah did
    not go
    down to his house,&rdquo; David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Did you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to
    your
    house?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And Uriah said to David, &ldquo;The ark and Israel and
    Judah
    are staying in <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1460-3" epub:type="noteref"

    servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Should I then go to my house to eat and drink and to sleep with
    my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then David said to Uriah, &ldquo;Stay here today also,
    and
    tomorrow I will let you go <i class="calibre12">back.</i>&rdquo; So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the day
    after.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Now David summoned <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1460-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1460-4">f</a></sup></small>Uriah, and he ate and drank in his presence, and he
    made <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1460-5" epub:type="noteref"

      class="calibre12">Uriah</i> went out to lie on his bed with his lord&rsquo;s servants, and he <i
      class="calibre12">still</i> did not go down to his house.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> So in the
    morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent <i class="calibre12">it</i> by the hand of Uriah.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>He had written in the letter <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1461-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1461-1">g</a></sup></small>the following: &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1461-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1461-2">h</a></sup></small>Station Uriah on the front line of the <small

          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1461-3">i</a></sup></small>fiercest battle and pull back from him, so that he
    may be struck and killed.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So it was as Joab kept watch on the city, that he
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1461-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1461-4">j</a></sup></small>stationed Uriah at the place where he knew there <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> valiant men.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And the men of the city went out and fought against
    Joab, and some of the people among David&rsquo;s servants fell; and Uriah the Hittite also died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then Joab sent <i class="calibre12">a messenger</i> and
    reported to David all the events of the war.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>He ordered the messenger, saying, &ldquo;When you have
    finished telling all the events of the war to the king,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>then it shall be that if the king&rsquo;s wrath rises
    and he
    says to you, &lsquo;Why did you move against the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the
    wall?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Who struck Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth? Did a
    woman not throw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you move against the
    wall?&rsquo;â€”then you shall say, &lsquo;Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> So the
    messenger departed and came and reported to David everything that Joab had sent him <i class="calibre12">to
      tell.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>The messenger said to David, &ldquo;The men prevailed
    against
    us and came out against us in the field, but we <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1462-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1462-1">k</a></sup></small>pressed them as far as the
    entrance of the gate.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Also, the archers shot at your servants from the wall;
    so some of the king&rsquo;s servants died, and your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then David said to the messenger, &ldquo;This is what
    you
    shall say to Joab: &lsquo;Do not let this thing <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1462-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1462-2">l</a></sup></small>displease you, for the sword
    devours one as well as another; <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1462-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0011_split_018.html#f1462-3">m</a></sup></small>fight with determination against
    the city and overthrow it&rsquo;; and <i class="calibre12">thereby</i> encourage him.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> Now when
    Uriah&rsquo;s wife heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for her husband.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>When the <i class="calibre12">time of</i> mourning was
    over, David sent <i class="calibre12">servants</i> and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    brought to his house and she became his wife; then she bore him a son. But the thing that David had done was evil in
    the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
