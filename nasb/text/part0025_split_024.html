            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">I heard</i> the sound

            sound.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So the Spirit lifted me up and took me away;
            and I went
            embittered in the rage of my spirit, and the hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was strong on me.

            shall die for wrongdoing, but his blood I will require from your hand.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>However if you have warned the wicked and he
            does not
            turn from his wickedness or from his wicked way, he shall die for wrongdoing, but you have saved yourself.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Again, when a righteous person turns away from
            his
            righteousness and commits sin, and I place an obstacle before him, he will die; since you have not warned
            him, he
            shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I
            will
            require from your hand.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>However, if you have warned <small

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Now
            the hand

            I will speak to you.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So I got up and went out to the plain; and
