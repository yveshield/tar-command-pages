  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Moses&rsquo; Last Counsel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And he said to them, &ldquo;I am 120 years old today; I
    am no
    longer able to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source982-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f982-1">a</a></sup></small>go out and come in, and the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has told me, &lsquo;You shall not cross this Jordan.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>It is the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God who
    is going to cross ahead of you; He Himself will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them.
    Joshua is the one who is going to cross ahead of you, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has spoken.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will do to them
    just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will turn them over
    to you, and you will do to them in accordance with all the commandments which I have commanded you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or in dread
    of them, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God is the One who is going with you. He will not desert you
    or abandon you.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then Moses
    called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all Israel, &ldquo;Be strong and courageous, for you will go with
    this
    people into the land which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you
    will give it to them as an inheritance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is the one who
    is going ahead of you; He will be with you. He will not desert you or abandon you. Do not fear and do not be
    dismayed.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> So Moses wrote
    this Law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, and to all the elders of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Moses commanded them, saying, &ldquo;At the end of
    <i class="calibre12">every</i> seven years, at the time of the year of the release of debts, at the Feast of Booths,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>when all Israel comes to appear before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God at the place which He will choose, you shall read this Law before all Israel
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source983-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f983-1">b</a></sup></small>so that they hear <i class="calibre12">it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Assemble the people, the men, the women, the children,
    and the stranger who is in your <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source983-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f983-2">c</a></sup></small>town, so that they may hear and learn and fear the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God, and be careful to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source983-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0008_split_009.html#f983-3">d</a></sup></small>follow all the
    words of this Law.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And their children, who have not known, will hear and
    learn to fear the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God, as long as you live on the land <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source983-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f983-4">e</a></sup></small>which you are about to cross the Jordan to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source983-5" epub:type="noteref"

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Israel Will Fall Away</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses,
    &ldquo;Behold, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source984-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f984-1">g</a></sup></small>the time for you to die is near; call Joshua and
    present yourselves at the tent of meeting, and I will commission him.&rdquo; So Moses and Joshua went and presented
    themselves at the tent of meeting.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> appeared in
    the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood at the entrance of the tent.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Moses,
    &ldquo;Behold, you are about to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source984-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f984-2">h</a></sup></small>lie down with your fathers; and this people will
    arise and play the prostitute with the foreign gods of the land into the midst of which they are going, and they
    will abandon Me and break My covenant which I have made with them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then My anger will be kindled against them on that day,
    and I will abandon them and hide My face from them, and they will be consumed, and many evils and troubles will find
    them; so they will say on that day, &lsquo;Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have found
    us?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But I will assuredly hide My face on that day because
    of all the evil that they will have done, for they will have turned away to other gods.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> &ldquo;Now
    then,
    write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source985-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f985-1">i</a></sup></small>on their lips, so that this song may be a witness for
    Me against the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>For when I bring them into the land flowing with milk
    and honey, which I swore to their fathers, and they eat and are satisfied and become <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source985-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f985-2">j</a></sup></small>prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and
    serve them, and spurn Me and break My covenant.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then it will come about, when many evils and troubles
    find them, that this song will testify before them as a witness (for it shall not be forgotten from the mouth of
    their <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source985-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f985-3">k</a></sup></small>descendants); for I know their inclination which they
    are <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source985-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0008_split_009.html#f985-4">l</a></sup></small>developing today, before I bring them into the land
    which I swore.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So Moses wrote down this song on the same day, and
    taught it to the sons of Israel.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Joshua Is Commissioned</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Then He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said,
    &ldquo;Be
    strong and courageous, for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I swore to them, and I will be with
    you.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> It came
    about, when Moses finished writing the words of this Law in a book until they were complete,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>that Moses commanded the Levites who carried the ark of
    the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>&ldquo;Take this Book of the Law and place it beside

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>For I know your rebellion and your <small

          href="part0008_split_009.html#f986-2">n</a></sup></small>stubbornness; behold, as long as I have been alive
    with you <i class="calibre12">until</i> today, you have been rebellious against the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>; how much more, then, after my death?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes and your
    officers, that I may speak these words in their hearing and call the heavens and the earth as witnesses against
    them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>For I know that after my death you will behave very
    corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will confront you in the latter days, because
    you will do that which is evil in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, provoking Him to anger with the
    work of your hands.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Then Moses
    spoke in the hearing of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were complete:
