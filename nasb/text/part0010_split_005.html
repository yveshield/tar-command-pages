  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Saul&rsquo;s Search</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now there was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of
    Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, son of a Benjaminite, a <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1296-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1296-1">a</a></sup></small>valiant mighty man.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He had a son whose name was Saul, a young and handsome
    <i class="calibre12">man,</i> and there was not a more handsome man than he among the sons of Israel; from his
    shoulders and up he was taller than any of the people.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Now the
    donkeys of Kish, Saul&rsquo;s father, had wandered off. So Kish said to his son Saul, &ldquo;Now take with you one
    of the
    servants and arise, go search for the donkeys.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So he passed through the hill country of Ephraim and
    passed through the land of Shalishah, but they did not find <i class="calibre12">them.</i> Then they passed through
    the land of Shaalim, but they were not <i class="calibre12">there.</i> Then he passed through the land of the
    Benjaminites, but they did not find <i class="calibre12">them.</i>
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> When they came
    to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, &ldquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s return, or else my
    father
    will stop
    <i class="calibre12">being concerned</i> about the donkeys and will become anxious about us.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But he said to him, &ldquo;Behold now, <i
      class="calibre12">there is</i> a man of God in this city, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says
    definitely comes <i class="calibre12">true.</i> Now let&rsquo;s go there, perhaps he can tell us about our journey
    on
    which we have set out.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Saul said to his servant, &ldquo;But look, if we
    go, what
    shall we bring the man? For the bread is gone from our sacks and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What
    do we have?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>The servant answered Saul again and said, &ldquo;Look, I
    have
    in my hand a fourth of a shekel of silver; I will give <i class="calibre12">it</i> to the man of God and he will
    tell us our way.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>(Previously in Israel, when a man went to inquire of
    God, he used to say, &ldquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s go to the seer&rdquo;; for <i class="calibre12">he who is
      called</i> a
    prophet
    now
    was previously called a seer.)
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Saul said to his servant, &ldquo;<small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1297-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1297-1">b</a></sup></small>Good idea; come, let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; So they went
    to
    the city
    where the man of God was.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> As they went
    up the slope to the city, they found young women going out to draw water, and they said to them, &ldquo;Is the seer
    here?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>They answered them and said, &ldquo;He is; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1298-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1298-1">c</a></sup></small>see, <i class="calibre12">he is</i> ahead of you.
    Hurry now, for he has come into the city today, because the people have a sacrifice on the high place today.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>As soon as you enter the city you will find him before
    he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must bless the
    sacrifice; afterward those who are invited will eat. Now then, go up, for you will find him about this time.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So they went up to the city. As they came into the
    city, behold, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the high place.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">God&rsquo;s Choice for King</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now a day before Saul&rsquo;s coming, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1299-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1299-1">d</a></sup></small>revealed <i
      class="calibre12">this</i> to Samuel, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>&ldquo;About this time tomorrow I will send you a man
    from
    the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as ruler over My people Israel; and he will save My people from the
    hand of the Philistines. For I have considered My people, because their outcry has come to Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>When Samuel saw Saul, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1299-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1299-2">e</a></sup></small>said to him, &ldquo;Behold, the man of whom I spoke
    to
    you! This one shall rule over My people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and said,
    &ldquo;Please tell me where the seer&rsquo;s house is.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And Samuel answered Saul and said, &ldquo;I am the
    seer. Go
    up ahead of me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will
    tell you everything that is on your mind.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And as for your donkeys that wandered off three days
    ago, do not be concerned about them, for they have been found. And for whom is everything that is desirable in
    Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father&rsquo;s household?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Saul replied, &ldquo;Am I not a Benjaminite, of the
    smallest
    of the tribes of Israel, and my family the least of all the families of the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1299-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1299-3">f</a></sup></small>tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in
    this way?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Then Samuel
    took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall, and gave them a place at the head of those who were
    invited, who were about thirty men.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And Samuel said to the cook, &ldquo;<small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1300-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1300-1">g</a></sup></small>Serve the portion that I gave you about which I said
    to you, &lsquo;Set it <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1300-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1300-2">h</a></sup></small>aside.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then the cook took up the leg with what was on it and
    placed <i class="calibre12">it</i> before Saul. And <i class="calibre12">Samuel</i> said, &ldquo;Here is what has
    been
    reserved! Place <i class="calibre12">it</i> before you <i class="calibre12">and</i> eat, because it has been kept
    for you until the appointed time, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1300-3"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1300-3">i</a></sup></small>since I said I have invited the
    people.&rdquo; So Saul ate with Samuel that day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> When they
    came down from the high place <i class="calibre12">into</i> the city, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1301-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1301-1">j</a></sup></small><i class="calibre12">Samuel</i> spoke with Saul on
    the roof.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And they got up early; and at daybreak Samuel called to
    Saul on the roof, saying, &ldquo;Get up, so that I may send you on your way.&rdquo; So Saul got up, and both he and
    Samuel
    went
    out into the street.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>As they were going down to the edge of the city, Samuel
    said to Saul, &ldquo;Speak to the servant and have him go on ahead of us and pass by; but you stand <i
      class="calibre12">here</i> now, so that I may proclaim the word of God to you.&rdquo;
