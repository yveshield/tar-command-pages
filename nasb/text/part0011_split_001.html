    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about, when the king lived in his house, and the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had given him rest on every side from all his enemies,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>that the king said to Nathan the prophet, &ldquo;See
    now, I
    live in a house of cedar, but the ark of God remains within the tent.&rdquo;

    what the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;Should you build Me a house for My dwelling?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought
    up the sons of Israel from Egypt, even to this day; rather, I have been moving about in a tent, that is, in a
    dwelling place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Wherever I have gone with all the sons of Israel, did I
    speak a word with one of the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, saying, &lsquo;Why
    have you
    not built Me a house of cedar?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
