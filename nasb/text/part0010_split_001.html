  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Capture of the Ark Provokes God</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it from
    Ebenezer to Ashdod.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it
    into the house of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>When the Ashdodites got up early the next day, behold,
    Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. So they took
    Dagon and set him back in his place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>But when they got up early the next morning, behold,
    Dagon had fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. And the head of
    Dagon and both palms of his hands <i class="calibre12">were</i> cut off on the threshold; <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1285-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1285-1">a</a></sup></small>only the torso of Dagon was left.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For that reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who
    enter Dagon&rsquo;s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Now the hand
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was heavy on the Ashdodites, and He made them feel devastated and struck
    them with tumors, <i class="calibre12">both</i> Ashdod and its territories.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said,
    &ldquo;The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, because His hand is severe on us and on Dagon our
    god.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So they sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and gathered
    all the governors of the Philistines to them, and said, &ldquo;What shall we do with the ark of the God of
    Israel?&rdquo;
    And
    they said, &ldquo;Have the ark of the God of Israel <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1286-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1286-1">b</a></sup></small>brought to
    Gath.&rdquo; So they took
    the ark of the God of Israel away.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>After they had taken it away, the hand of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was against the city, <i class="calibre12">creating</i> a very great panic; and He
    struck the people of the city, from the young to the old, so that tumors broke out on them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of
    God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, saying, &ldquo;They have brought the ark of the God of Israel to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1286-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1286-2">c</a></sup></small>us, to kill <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1286-2">c</a></sup></small>us and <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Therefore they sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> and
    gathered all the governors of the Philistines, and said, &ldquo;Send away the ark of the God of Israel and let it
    return
    to its own place, so that it will not kill <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1286-5"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1286-4">e</a></sup></small>us and <small

          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1286-5">f</a></sup></small>our people!&rdquo; For there was a deadly panic
    throughout
    the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And the people who did not die were struck with tumors,
    and the outcry of the city went up to heaven.
