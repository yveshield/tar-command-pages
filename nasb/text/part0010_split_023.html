  <p class="head">1 SAMUEL 27&nbsp;<a href="part0001_split_000.html#bob" class="calibre7"><span

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Flees to the Philistines</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then David said to <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1395-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1395-1">a</a></sup></small>himself, &ldquo;Now I will <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1395-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1395-2">b</a></sup></small>perish one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing
    better for me than to safely escape into the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will despair of searching for me
    anymore in all the territory of Israel, and I will escape from his hand.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So David set out and went over, he and the six hundred
    men who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And David lived with Achish in Gath, he and his men,
    each with his <i class="calibre12">own</i> householdâ€”David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail
    the Carmelitess, Nabal&rsquo;s <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1395-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1395-3">c</a></sup></small>widow.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now it was reported to Saul that David had fled to Gath,
    so he no longer searched for him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then David
    said to Achish, &ldquo;If now I have found favor in your sight, have them give me a place in one of the cities in
    the
    country, so that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Achish gave him Ziklag that day; therefore Ziklag has
    belonged to the kings of Judah to this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The number of days that David lived in the country of
    the Philistines was a year and four months.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Now David and
    his men went up and attacked the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for they were the inhabitants of the
    land from ancient times, as you come to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>David <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1396-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1396-1">d</a></sup></small>attacked the
    land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, and he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the
    clothing. Then he returned and came to Achish.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now Achish said, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1396-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1396-2">e</a></sup></small>Where did you carry out an attack today?&rdquo; And
    David
    said, &ldquo;Against the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1396-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1396-3">f</a></sup></small>Negev of Judah, against the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1396-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1396-3">f</a></sup></small>Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1396-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1396-3">f</a></sup></small>Negev of the Kenites.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring
    to Gath, saying, &ldquo;Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, &lsquo;This is what David has done, and this <i
      class="calibre12">has been</i> his practice all the time that he has lived in the country of the
    Philistines.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So Achish believed David, saying, &ldquo;He has
    undoubtedly
    made himself repulsive among his people Israel; therefore he will become my servant forever.&rdquo;
