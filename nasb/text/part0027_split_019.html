            toward Jerusalem); and he continued kneeling on his knees three times a day, praying and offering praise

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then,
            as soon
            as the king heard this statement, he was deeply distressed, and set <i class="calibre12">his</i> mind on
            rescuing
            Daniel; and until sunset he kept exerting himself to save him.

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then the king went to his palace and spent the

            fasting, and no entertainment was brought before him; and his sleep fled from him.

            cried
            out with a troubled voice. The king began speaking and said to Daniel, &ldquo;Daniel, servant of the living

            him,
            because he had trusted in his God.
