  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now David assembled at Jerusalem all the officials of Israel,
    the leaders of the tribes, and the commanders of the divisions that served the king, the commanders of thousands,
    and the commanders of hundreds, and the overseers of all the property and livestock belonging to the king and his
    sons, with the officials and the mighty men, all the valiant warriors.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then King David rose to his feet and said, &ldquo;Listen
    to
    me, my brothers and my people; <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1958-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But God said to me, &lsquo;You shall not build a house
    for My
    name, because you are a man of war and have shed blood.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Yet, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of
    Israel, chose me from all the household of my father to be king over Israel forever. For He has chosen Judah to be a
    leader; and in the house of Judah, my father&rsquo;s house, and among the sons of my father He took pleasure in me
    to make
    <i class="calibre12">me</i> king over all Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Of all my sons (for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    has given me many sons), He has chosen my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He said to me, &lsquo;Your son Solomon is the one who
    shall
    build My house and My courtyards; for I have chosen him to be a son to Me, and I will be a Father to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>I will establish his kingdom forever if he resolutely

    seek after all the commandments of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God so that you may possess the good
    land and leave it as an inheritance to your sons after you forever.
