    So they took possession of Samaria and lived in its cities.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>And at the beginning of their living there, they did
    not fear the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; therefore the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> sent lions among them
    that were killing some of them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>So they spoke to the king of Assyria, saying,
    &ldquo;The
    nations whom you have taken into exile and settled in the cities of Samaria do not know the custom of the God of the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> Then the king

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>The men of Babylon made Succoth-benoth, the men of Cuth

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>And the statutes, the ordinances, the Law, and the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>The covenant that I have made with you, you shall not

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>However, they did not listen, but they kept acting in

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>So while these nations feared the L<span
