  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The King Plans to Honor Mordecai</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> During that night <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2263-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2263-1">a</a></sup></small>the king could not sleep, so he gave an order to
    bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And it was found written what Mordecai had reported
    about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king&rsquo;s eunuchs who were doorkeepers, that they had sought to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2263-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2263-2">b</a></sup></small>attack King Ahasuerus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the king said, &ldquo;What honor or dignity has
    been
    bestowed on Mordecai for this?&rdquo; And the king&rsquo;s servants who attended him said, &ldquo;Nothing has been
    done
    for
    him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the king said, &ldquo;Who is in the courtyard?&rdquo;
    Now
    Haman
    had <i class="calibre12">just</i> entered the outer courtyard of the king&rsquo;s palace in order to speak to the
    king
    about hanging Mordecai on the wooden <i class="calibre12">gallows</i> which he had prepared for him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So the king&rsquo;s servants said to him, &ldquo;Behold,
    Haman
    is
    standing in the courtyard.&rdquo; And the king said, &ldquo;Have him come in.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Haman then came in and the king said to him, &ldquo;What
    is to
    be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?&rdquo; And Haman said <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2263-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2263-3">c</a></sup></small>to himself,
    &ldquo;Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Therefore Haman said to the king, &ldquo;For the man
    whom the
    king desires to honor,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>have them bring a royal robe which the king has worn,
    and the horse on which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal turban has been placed;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>then <i class="calibre12">order them</i> to hand the
    robe and the horse over to one of the king&rsquo;s noble officials, and have them dress the man whom the king
    desires to
    honor, and lead him on horseback through the city square, and proclaim before him, &lsquo;So it shall be done for
    the man
    whom the king desires to honor.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Haman Must Honor Mordecai</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then the king said to Haman, &ldquo;Quickly, take the robe
    and the
    horse just as you have said, and do so for Mordecai the Jew, who is sitting at the king&rsquo;s gate; do not fail to
    do
    anything of all that you have said.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So Haman took the robe and the horse, and dressed
    Mordecai, and led him <i class="calibre12">on horseback</i> through the city square, and proclaimed before him,
    &ldquo;So
    it shall be done for the man whom the king desires to honor.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Mordecai
    returned to the king&rsquo;s gate, while Haman hurried home, mourning, with <i class="calibre12">his</i> head
    covered.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And Haman informed Zeresh his wife and all his friends
    of everything that had happened to him. Then his wise men and Zeresh his wife said to him, &ldquo;If Mordecai,
    before whom
    you have begun to fall, is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2264-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0016_split_008.html#f2264-1">d</a></sup></small>of Jewish origin, you will not prevail over him, but
    will certainly fall before him.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> While they
    were still talking with him, the king&rsquo;s eunuchs arrived and quickly brought Haman to the banquet which Esther
    had
    prepared.
