      <p class="aleft">
            <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came
            to Jonah
            the son of Amittai, saying,
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Arise, go to Nineveh, the great city, and
            cry out
            against it, because their wickedness has come up before Me.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But Jonah got up to flee to Tarshish from the
            presence
            of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. So he went down to Joppa, found a ship that was going to Tarshish,
            paid the
            fare, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5765-1" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0028_split_031.html#f5765-1">a</a></sup></small>boarded it to go with them to
            Tarshish away from the
            presence of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span>
            However, the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span> hurled a great wind on the sea and there was a great storm on the sea, so
            that the
            ship was about to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5766-1" epub:type="noteref"

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then the sailors became afraid and every man
            cried out
            to his <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5766-2" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0028_split_031.html#f5766-2">c</a></sup></small>god, and they hurled the <small

                              href="part0028_split_031.html#f5766-3">d</a></sup></small>cargo which was in the ship into
            the sea to lighten
            <i class="calibre12">it</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5766-4"

            But Jonah had gone below into the stern of
            the ship, had lain down, and fallen sound asleep.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So the captain approached him and said,
            &ldquo;How is it that
            you are sleeping? Get up, call on your god! Perhaps <i class="calibre12">your</i> god will be concerned
            about us so
            that we will not perish.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> And
            each man
            said to his mate, &ldquo;Come, let&rsquo;s cast lots so that we may <small class="small1"><sup
                        class="calibre14"><a id="source5767-1" epub:type="noteref"

            whose account this catastrophe <i class="calibre12">has struck</i> us.&rdquo; So they cast lots, and the lot
            fell
            on
            Jonah.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then they said to him, &ldquo;Tell us, now! On
            whose account
            <i class="calibre12">has</i> this catastrophe <i class="calibre12">struck</i> us? What is your occupation,
            and where
            do you come from? What is your country, and from what people are you?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So he said to them, &ldquo;I am a Hebrew, and I
            fear the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Then
            the men
            became extremely afraid, and they said to him, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
                              id="source5768-1" epub:type="noteref"

            For the
            men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, because he had told
            them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So they said to him, &ldquo;What should we do
            to you so that
            the sea will become calm <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5768-2"
                              epub:type="noteref" href="part0028_split_031.html#f5768-2">h</a></sup></small>for
            us?&rdquo;â€”for
            the sea was becoming increasingly
            stormy.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And he said to them, &ldquo;Pick me up and hurl
            me into the
            sea. Then the sea will become calm <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5768-3"
                              epub:type="noteref" href="part0028_split_031.html#f5768-3">i</a></sup></small>for you,
            because I know that on
            account of me this great storm <i class="calibre12">has come</i> upon you.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>However, the men <small class="small1"><sup
                        class="calibre14"><a id="source5768-4" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0028_split_031.html#f5768-4">j</a></sup></small>rowed <i
                  class="calibre12">desperately</i> to return
            to land, but they could not, because the sea was becoming <i class="calibre12">even</i> stormier against
            them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then they cried out to the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> and said, &ldquo;We earnestly pray, O L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, do
            not let us perish
            on account of this man&rsquo;s life, and do not put innocent blood on us; for You, L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span>, have
            done as You pleased.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> So
            they
            picked up Jonah and hurled him into the sea, and the sea stopped its raging.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then the men became extremely afraid of the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and they offered a sacrifice to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and
            made vows.
            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span>
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5769-1" epub:type="noteref"
                              href="part0028_split_031.html#f5769-1">k</a></sup></small>And the L<span
                  class="small1">ORD</span> designated
            a great fish to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was in the stomach of the fish for three days and three nights.
