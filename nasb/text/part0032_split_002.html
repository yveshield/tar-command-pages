    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">yet</i> they all alike began

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And another one said, &lsquo;I took a woman as my wife,

    for that reason I cannot come.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And the slave came <i class="calibre12">back</i> and
    reported this to his master. Then the head of the household became angry and said to his slave, &lsquo;Go out at
    once into
    the streets and lanes of the city and bring in here those who are poor, those with disabilities, those who are
    blind, and those who are limping.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">later</i> the slave said,
    &lsquo;Master, what you commanded has been done, and still there is room.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And the master said to the slave, &lsquo;Go out into

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>For I tell you, none of those men who were invited
    shall taste my dinner.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
