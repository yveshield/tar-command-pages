  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Joshua,
    &ldquo;Do
    not fear or be dismayed. Take all the people of war with you. Arise, go up to Ai; see, I have handed over to you the
    king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>You shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to
    Jericho and its king; you shall take only its spoils and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1050-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1050-1">a</a></sup></small>Set an ambush for the city behind it.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> So Joshua rose
    up with all the people of war to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand men, valiant warriors, and sent them
    out at night.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>He commanded them, saying, &ldquo;See, you are going to
    ambush
    the city from behind <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1051-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1051-1">b</a></sup></small>it. Do not go very far from the city, but all of you
    be ready.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then I and all the people who are with me will approach
    the city. And when they come out to meet us as <i class="calibre12">they did</i> the first <i
      class="calibre12">time,</i> we will flee before them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>They will come out after us until we have lured them
    away from the city, for they will say, &lsquo;<i class="calibre12">They</i> are fleeing before us just as <i
      class="calibre12">they did</i> the first time.&rsquo; So we will flee before them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then you shall rise from <i class="calibre12">your</i>
    ambush and take possession of the city, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God will hand it over to you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then it will be when you have seized the city, that you
    shall set the city on fire. You shall do <i class="calibre12">it</i> in accordance with the word of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>. See, I have commanded you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So Joshua sent them away, and they went to the <i
      class="calibre12">place of</i> ambush and remained between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent
    that night among the people.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> Now Joshua
    got up early in the morning and mustered the people, and he went up with the elders of Israel before the people to
    Ai.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then all the people of war who <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> with him went up and approached, and arrived in front of the city; and they camped on
    the north side of Ai. And <i class="calibre12">there was</i> a valley between him and Ai.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then he took about five thousand men and set them in
    ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1052-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1052-1">c</a></sup></small>city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So they stationed the people, all the army that was on
    the north side of the city, and its rear guard on the west side of the city, and Joshua spent that night in the
    midst of the valley.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And it came about, when the king of Ai saw <i
      class="calibre12">them,</i> that the men of the city hurried and got up early, and went out to meet Israel in
    battle, he and all his people at the appointed place before the desert plain. But he did not know that <i
      class="calibre12">there was</i> an ambush against him behind the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Joshua and all Israel <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1052-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1052-2">d</a></sup></small>pretended to be defeated before them, and fled by
    the way of the wilderness.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And all the people who were in the city were called
    together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So not a man was left in Ai or Bethel, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1052-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1052-3">e</a></sup></small>but they had all gone out after Israel, and they
    left the city <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1052-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1052-4">f</a></sup></small>unguarded and pursued Israel.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to Joshua, &ldquo;Reach out with the sword that is in your hand toward Ai, for
    I
    will hand it over to you.&rdquo; So Joshua reached out with the sword that was in his hand toward the city.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then the <i class="calibre12">men in</i> ambush rose
    quickly from their place, and when he had reached out with his hand, they ran and entered the city and captured it,
    and they quickly set the city on fire.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>When the men of Ai turned <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1053-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-1">g</a></sup></small>back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city
    ascended to the sky, and they had no place to flee this way or that, for the people who had been fleeing to the
    wilderness turned against the pursuers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>When Joshua and all Israel saw that the <i
      class="calibre12">men in</i> ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city ascended, they turned
    back and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1053-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-2">h</a></sup></small>killed the men of Ai.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1053-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-3">i</a></sup></small>The others
    came out from the city to confront them, so that they were <i class="calibre12">trapped</i> in the midst of Israel,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1053-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-4">j</a></sup></small>some on this side and some on that side; and they
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1053-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-5">k</a></sup></small>killed them until there was not one <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1053-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1053-6">l</a></sup></small>left who escaped or survived.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But they captured the king of Ai alive and brought him
    to Joshua.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> Now when
    Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and
    all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck
    it with the edge of the sword.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>So all who fell that day, both men and women, were
    twelve thousandâ€”all the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1054-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1054-1">m</a></sup></small>people of Ai.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he
    reached out with the sword until he had <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1054-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1054-2">n</a></sup></small>utterly destroyed all the
    inhabitants of Ai.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Israel took only the cattle and the spoils of that city
    as plunder for themselves, in accordance with the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which He had
    commanded Joshua.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So Joshua burned Ai and made it a refuse heap forever,
    a desolation until this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And he hanged the king of Ai on <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1054-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1054-3">o</a></sup></small>a tree until evening; but at sunset Joshua gave the
    command and they took his body down from <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1054-4"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0009_split_001.html#f1054-3">o</a></sup></small>the tree and threw it at the
    entrance of the city gate, and erected over it a large heap of stones <i class="calibre12">that stands</i> to this
    day.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Then Joshua
    built an altar to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>just as Moses the servant of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, an
    altar of uncut stones on which no one had wielded an iron <i class="calibre12">tool;</i> and they offered burnt
    offerings on it to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and sacrificed peace offerings.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>And he wrote there on the stones a copy of the Law of
    Moses, which <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1055-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0009_split_001.html#f1055-1">p</a></sup></small>he had written, in the presence of the sons of
    Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>And all Israel with their elders, officers, and their
    judges were standing on both sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the stranger as well as the native. Half of them <i
      class="calibre12">stood</i> in front of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the
    servant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded at first to bless the people of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Then afterward he read all the words of the Law, the
    blessing and the curse, according to everything that is written in the Book of the Law.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded
    which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel with the women, the little ones, and the strangers who
    were <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1055-2" epub:type="noteref"
