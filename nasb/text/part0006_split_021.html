  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Build seven altars for me
    here,
    and prepare seven bulls and seven rams for me here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Balak did just as Balaam had spoken, and Balak and
    Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on <i class="calibre12">each</i> altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Stand beside your
    burnt
    offering, and I will go; perhaps the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will come to meet me, and whatever He shows me
    I will tell you.&rdquo; So he went to a bare hill.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Now God met
    with Balaam, and he said to Him, &ldquo;I have set up the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> put a word in
    Balaam&rsquo;s mouth and said, &ldquo;Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So he returned to him, and behold, he was standing
    beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And he took up his discourse and said,
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;From Aram Balak has brought me, </div>
  <div class="block">Moab&rsquo;s king from the mountains of the East, <i class="calibre12">saying,</i> </div>

  <div class="block"> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>How am I to put a curse on him upon

  <p class="aleft">
  </p>
  <div class="block"> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For I see him from the top of the

  <div class="block">And I look at him from the hills; </div>
  <div class="block">Behold, a people that lives in isolation, </div>
  <div class="block">And does not consider itself <i class="calibre12">to be</i> among the nations.</div>

  </p>
  <div class="block"> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Who has counted the dust of Jacob,

  </div>
  <p class="aleft"><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;What have
    you done
    to me? I took you to put a curse on my enemies, but behold, you have actually blessed <i
      class="calibre12">them!&rdquo;</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>He replied, &ldquo;Must I not be careful to speak what
    the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then Balak
    said to him, &ldquo;Please come with me to another place from where you may see them, <i

    you will only see the extreme end of them and will not see all of them; and put a curse on them for me from
    there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So he took him to the field of Zophim, to the top of
    Pisgah, and he built seven altars and offered a bull and a ram on <i class="calibre12">each</i> altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then he said to Balak, &ldquo;Stand here beside your

    over there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> met Balaam
    and put a word in his mouth, and said, &ldquo;Return to Balak, and this is what you shall speak.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>So he came to him, and behold, he was standing beside
    his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab with him. And Balak said to him, &ldquo;What has the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then he took up his discourse and said,

  <p class="aleft">
  </p>
  <div class="block"> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>For there is no magic curse against
    Jacob, </div>
  <div class="block">Nor is there any divination against Israel; </div>
  <div class="block">At the <i class="calibre12">proper</i> time it shall be said to Jacob </div>

  <p class="aleft"><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Do not curse
    them

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>But Balaam replied to Balak, &ldquo;Did I not tell you,
