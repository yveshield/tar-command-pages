    out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>When they reached Salamis, they <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>When they had gone through the whole island as far as
    Paphos, they found a magician, a Jewish false prophet whose name was Bar-Jesus,

    went
    about seeking those who would lead him by the hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then the proconsul believed when he saw what had
    happened, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.
