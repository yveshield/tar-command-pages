            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then
            the king

            right or
            to the left
            from anything that my lord the king has spoken. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me, and it
            was he who
            put all these words in the mouth of your servant.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>In order to change the appearance of things
            your

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>And Joab fell on his face to the ground,
            prostrated
            himself, and blessed the king; then Joab said, &ldquo;Today your servant knows that I have found favor in

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So Joab arose and went to Geshur, and brought
            Absalom
            to Jerusalem.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>However, the king said, &ldquo;He shall return
            to his own
            house, but he shall not see my face.&rdquo; So Absalom returned to his own house and did not see the
            king&rsquo;s

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> Now
            in all

            there was no impairment in him.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And when he cut the hair of his head (and it
            was at the
            end of every year that he cut <i class="calibre12">it,</i> because it was heavy on him, so he cut it), he
            weighed

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>And to Absalom there were born three sons, and
            one
            daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a woman of beautiful appearance.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> Now
            Absalom
            lived two full years in Jerusalem, yet he did not see the king&rsquo;s face.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Then Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the
            king,
            but he would not come to him. So he sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> again a second time, but he would not
            come.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Therefore he said to his servants, &ldquo;See,

            plot on
            fire.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Then Joab got up, came to Absalom at his house,
            and
            said to him, &ldquo;Why have your servants set my plot on fire?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Absalom <small class="small1"><sup

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>So when Joab came to the king and told him, he
            summoned
