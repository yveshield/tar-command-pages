            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Judah spoke to him, however, saying, &ldquo;The

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Then Israel said, &ldquo;Why did you treat me so

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So Judah said to his father Israel, &ldquo;Send

            was a
            mistake.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Take your brother also, and arise, return to

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So the men took this gift, and they took double
