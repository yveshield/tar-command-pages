            anyone,
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>came up behind Him and touched the fringe of
            His <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6390-1" epub:type="noteref"

            bleeding stopped.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">45</sup></small>And Jesus said, &ldquo;Who is the one who
            touched Me?&rdquo;
            And
            while they were all denying it, Peter said, &ldquo;Master, the <small class="small1"><sup
                        class="calibre14"><a id="source6390-2" epub:type="noteref"

            crowding and pressing in on You.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">46</sup></small>But Jesus said, &ldquo;Someone did touch Me,
            for I was
            aware
            that power had left Me.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">47</sup></small>Now when the woman saw that she had not escaped
            notice,
            she came trembling and fell down before Him, and admitted in the presence of all the people the reason why
            she had
            touched Him, and how she had been immediately healed.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">48</sup></small>And He said to her, &ldquo;Daughter, your faith
            has
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6390-3" epub:type="noteref"

            peace.&rdquo;

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">49</b></span> While
            He was

            &ldquo;Your
            daughter has died; do not trouble the Teacher anymore.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>But when Jesus heard <i
                  class="calibre12">this,</i> He
            responded to him, &ldquo;Do not be afraid <i class="calibre12">any longer;</i> only believe, and she will be

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>When He came to the house, He did not allow
            anyone to
            enter with Him except Peter, John, and James, and the girl&rsquo;s father and mother.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">52</sup></small>Now they were all weeping and mourning for her;
            but He
            said, &ldquo;Stop weeping, for she has not died, but is asleep.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>And they <i class="calibre12">began</i>
            laughing at
            Him, knowing that she had died.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">54</sup></small>He, however, took her by the hand and spoke

                              href="part0032_split_012.html#f6391-2">z</a></sup></small>forcefully, saying,
            &ldquo;Child, arise!&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">55</sup></small>And her spirit returned, and she got up
            immediately;
            and He ordered that <i class="calibre12">something</i> be given her to eat.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">56</sup></small>Her parents were amazed; but He instructed them
            to tell
            no one what had happened.
