  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron
    and his sons and the elders of Israel;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and he said to Aaron, &ldquo;Take for yourself a calf, a
    bull,
    as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, <i class="calibre12">both</i> without defect, and offer <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying,
    &lsquo;Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without defect, as a burnt
    offering,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
    before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and a grain offering mixed with oil; for today the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> will appear to you.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of
    the tent of meeting, and the whole congregation came near and stood before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And Moses said, &ldquo;This is the thing which the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    may
    appear to you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Moses then said to Aaron, &ldquo;Come near to the altar
    and
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source524-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f524-1">a</a></sup></small>offer your sin offering and your burnt offering, so
    that you may make atonement for yourself and for the people; then make the offering <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source524-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f524-2">b</a></sup></small>for the people, so that you may make atonement for
    them, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has commanded.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> So Aaron came
    near to the altar and slaughtered the calf of the sin offering which was for himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Aaron&rsquo;s sons then presented the blood to him; and
    he
    dipped his finger in the blood and put <i class="calibre12">some</i> on the horns of the altar, and poured out <i
      class="calibre12">the rest of</i> the blood at the base of the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The fat and the kidneys and the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source525-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f525-1">c</a></sup></small>lobe of the liver of the sin offering he then offered
    up in smoke on the altar, just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded Moses.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The flesh and the hide, however, he burned with fire
    outside the camp.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then he
    slaughtered the burnt offering; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons brought the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the
    altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>They brought the burnt offering to him in <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source526-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f526-1">d</a></sup></small>pieces, with the head, and he offered <i
      class="calibre12">them</i> up in smoke on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered
    <i class="calibre12">them</i> up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then he
    presented the people&rsquo;s offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and
    slaughtered it
    and offered it for sin, like the first.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>He also presented the burnt offering, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source527-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f527-1">e</a></sup></small>offered it according to the ordinance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Next he presented the grain offering, and filled his
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source527-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f527-2">f</a></sup></small>hand with some of it and offered <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> up in smoke on the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then he
    slaughtered the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron&rsquo;s sons
    brought
    the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>As for the portions of fat from the ox and from the
    ram, the fat tail, the <i class="calibre12">fat</i> covering, the kidneys, and the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source528-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>they now placed the portions of fat on the breasts; and
    he offered <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source528-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f528-2">h</a></sup></small>them up in smoke on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source528-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0005_split_027.html#f528-3">i</a></sup></small>presented as a wave offering before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, just as Moses had commanded.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Then Aaron
    lifted up his hands toward the people and blessed them, and he stepped down after making the sin offering, the burnt
    offering, and the peace offerings.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And Moses and Aaron went into the tent of meeting. When
    they came out and blessed the people, the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> appeared to all the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then fire went out from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the
    people saw <i class="calibre12">it,</i> they shouted and fell <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
