  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Parable of the Good Shepherd</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> &ldquo;Truly, truly I say to you, the one who does not enter
    by the
    door into the fold of the sheep, but climbs up some other way, he is a thief and a robber.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But the one who enters by the door is a shepherd of the
    sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>To him the doorkeeper opens, and the sheep listen to his
    voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>When he puts all his own <i class="calibre12">sheep</i>
    outside, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they know his voice.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>However, a stranger they simply will not follow, but
    will flee from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Jesus told them this figure of speech, but they did not
    understand what the things which He was saying to them <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> So Jesus said
    to them again, &ldquo;Truly, truly I say to you, I am the door of the sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>All those who came before Me are thieves and robbers,
    but the sheep did not listen to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>I am the door; if anyone enters through Me, he will be
    saved, and will go in and out and find pasture.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I
    came so that they would have life, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6573-1"

    abundantly.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> &ldquo;I am
    the
    good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>He who is a hired hand, and not a shepherd, who is not
    the owner of the sheep, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep and flees; and the wolf snatches them and
    scatters <i class="calibre12">the flock.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small><i class="calibre12">He flees</i> because he is a hired
    hand and does not care about the sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>I am the good shepherd, and I know My own, and My own
    know Me,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>just as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and
    I lay down My life for the sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I
    must bring them also, and they will listen to My voice; and they will become one flock, <i
      class="calibre12">with</i> one shepherd.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For this reason the Father loves Me, because I lay down
    My life so that I may take it back.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>No one has taken it away from Me, but I lay it down on
    My own. I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it back. This commandment I received from My
    Father.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Dissension
    occurred again among the Jews because of these words.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Many of them were saying, &ldquo;He has a demon and is
    insane. Why do you listen to Him?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Others were saying, &ldquo;These are not the words of
    one who
    is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of those who are blind, can it?&rdquo;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>The Jews then surrounded Him and <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I told you, and you do not

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> The Jews
    picked up stones again to stone Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Jesus replied to them, &ldquo;I showed you many good
    works
    from the Father; for which of them are you stoning Me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>The Jews answered Him, &ldquo;We are not stoning You
    for a
    good work, but for blasphemy; and because You, being a man, make Yourself <i class="calibre12">out to be</i>
    God.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Jesus answered them, &ldquo;Has it not been written in

    sent into the world, &lsquo;You are blaspheming,&rsquo; because I said, &lsquo;I am the Son of God&rsquo;?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe

    eluded their grasp.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">40</b></span> And He went
    away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John was first baptizing, and He stayed there.
