  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now He was telling them a parable to show that at all times
    they ought to pray and not become discouraged,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>saying, &ldquo;In a certain city there was a judge who
    did not
    fear God and did not respect <i class="calibre12">any</i> person.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Now there was a widow in that city, and she kept coming
    to him, saying, &lsquo;Give me justice against my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6462-1"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For a while he was unwilling; but later he said to
    himself, &lsquo;Even though I do not fear God nor respect <i class="calibre12">any</i> person,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>yet because this widow is bothering me, I will give her
    justice; otherwise <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6462-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0032_split_012.html#f6462-2">b</a></sup></small>by continually coming she will wear me
    out.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And the Lord said, &ldquo;Listen to what the unrighteous
    judge
    *said;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>now, will God not bring about justice for His elect who
    cry out to Him day <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6462-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0032_split_012.html#f6462-3">c</a></sup></small>and night, and will He delay long for them?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>I tell you that He will bring about justice for them
    quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will He find <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Pharisee and the Tax Collector</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Now He also told this parable to some people who trusted in
    themselves that they were righteous, and viewed others with contempt:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>&ldquo;Two men went up into the <small

    collector.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The Pharisee stood and <i class="calibre12">began</i>
    praying this in regard to himself: &lsquo;God, I thank You that I am not like other people: swindlers, crooked,
    adulterers, or even like this tax collector.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>I fast twice a week; I pay tithes of all that I
    get.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was
    even unwilling to raise his eyes toward heaven, but was beating his chest, saying, &lsquo;God, be <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6463-2" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather
    than the other one; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be
    exalted.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Now they were
    bringing even their babies to Him so that He would touch them; but when the disciples saw <i
      class="calibre12">it,</i> they <i class="calibre12">began</i> rebuking them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But Jesus called for <small class="small1"><sup

    as these.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Truly I say to you, whoever does not receive the
    kingdom of God like a child will not enter it at all.&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Rich Young Ruler</i></p>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Now when Jesus heard <i class="calibre12">this,</i> He
    said to him, &ldquo;One thing you still lack; sell all that you possess and distribute <i class="calibre12">the

    to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>But when he had heard these things, he became very sad,
    for he was extremely wealthy.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And Jesus looked at him and said, &ldquo;How hard it is
    for
    those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!

    &ldquo;And

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>But He said, &ldquo;The things that are impossible with

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Now He took
