    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">69</b></span> Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a slave
    woman came to him and said, &ldquo;You too were with Jesus the Galilean.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">70</sup></small>But he denied <i class="calibre12">it</i> before them

    an oath: &ldquo;I do not know the man.&rdquo;
