    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now after him
    was Shammah the son of Agee, a Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered <small class="small1"><sup

    the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time to the cave of Adullam, while the army of the
    Philistines was camping in the Valley of Rephaim.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>David was then in the stronghold, while the garrison of
    the Philistines was then in Bethlehem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And David had a craving and said, &ldquo;Oh that
    someone
    would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So the three mighty men forced their way into the camp
    of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and carried <i

    it out as an offering to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>;

    went at <i class="calibre12">the risk of</i> their lives?&rdquo; So he would not drink it. These things the three
    mighty
    men did.
