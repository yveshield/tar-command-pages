  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David and Jonathan&rsquo;s Covenant</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and he came and said
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-1">a</a></sup></small>to Jonathan, &ldquo;What have I done? What is my
    guilt?
    And what is my sin before your father, that he is seeking my life?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He said to him, &ldquo;Far from it, you shall not die!
    Behold,
    my father does nothing either great or small <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-2">b</a></sup></small>without informing me. So why
    would my father hide this thing from me? It is not so!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Yet David vowed again, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-3">c</a></sup></small>saying, &ldquo;Your father is well aware that I have
    found
    favor in your sight, and he has said, &lsquo;Jonathan is not to know this, otherwise he will be worried.&rsquo; But
    indeed
    as
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives and as your soul lives, there is <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-4">d</a></sup></small>just a step between me and death.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Then Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Whatever <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-5">e</a></sup></small>you say, I will do for you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So David said to Jonathan, &ldquo;Behold, tomorrow is
    the new
    moon, and I am obligated to sit down to eat with the king. But let me go so that I may hide myself in the field
    until the third evening.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>If your father misses me at all, then say, &lsquo;David
    earnestly requested <i class="calibre12">leave</i> of me to run to Bethlehem, his city, because it is the yearly
    sacrifice there for the whole family.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>If he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1359-6" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-6">f</a></sup></small>says,
    &lsquo;<i class="calibre12">That is</i> good,&rsquo; your servant <i class="calibre12">will be</i> safe; but if he
    is very
    angry,
    be aware that he has decided on evil.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So deal kindly with your servant, for you have brought
    your servant into a covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with you. But if <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-7" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-7">g</a></sup></small>I am guilty of wrongdoing, kill me yourself; for why
    then should you bring me to your father?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Jonathan said, &ldquo;Far be it from you! For if I in
    fact
    learn that my father has decided <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-8"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-8">h</a></sup></small>to inflict harm on you, would I
    not inform you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then David said to Jonathan, &ldquo;Who will inform me
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1359-9" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1359-9">i</a></sup></small>if your father answers you harshly?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Come, and let&rsquo;s go
    out
    to the
    field.&rdquo; So both of them went out to the field.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Jonathan
    said to David, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel, <i class="calibre12">is my
      witness!</i>
    When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow <i class="calibre12">or</i> the third day, behold, <i
      class="calibre12">if he has a</i> good <i class="calibre12">feeling</i> toward <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1360-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1360-1">j</a></sup></small>you, shall I not then send <i
      class="calibre12">word</i> to you and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1360-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1360-2">k</a></sup></small>inform you?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>If it pleases my father <i class="calibre12">to do</i>
    you harm, may the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> do so to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1360-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1360-3">l</a></sup></small>me and more
    so, if I <i class="calibre12">fail to</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1360-4"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1360-4">m</a></sup></small>inform you and send you away, so
    that you may go in safety. And may the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> be with you as He has been with my father.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And if I am still alive, will you not show me the
    faithfulness of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, so that I do not die?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And you shall never cut off your loyalty to my house,
    not even when the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the
    earth.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Jonathan made a <i class="calibre12">covenant</i>
    with the house of David, <i class="calibre12">saying,</i> &ldquo;May the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> demand <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> from the hands of David&rsquo;s enemies.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And Jonathan made David vow again because of his love
    for him, because he loved him as he loved his own life.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Then Jonathan
    said to him, &ldquo;Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed since your seat will be empty.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down
    quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day, and you shall remain beside the stone
    Ezel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And I will shoot three arrows to the side, as though I
    shot at a target.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then behold, I will send the boy, <i
      class="calibre12">telling him,</i> &lsquo;Go, find the arrows.&rsquo; If I specifically say to the boy,
    &lsquo;Behold,
    the arrows
    are on this side of you, get them,&rsquo; then come, because it is safe for you and there is nothing <i
      class="calibre12">to harm you,</i> as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But if I <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1361-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1361-1">n</a></sup></small>say to the youth, &lsquo;Behold, the arrows are
    beyond
    you,&rsquo; go, because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has sent you away.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>As for the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1361-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1361-2">o</a></sup></small>agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold,
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is between you and me forever.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">24</b></span> So David hid
    himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Now the king sat on his seat as usual, the seat by the
    wall; then Jonathan stood up and Abner sat down by Saul&rsquo;s side; but David&rsquo;s place was empty.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Nevertheless Saul did not say anything that day,
    because he thought, &ldquo;It <i class="calibre12">must have been</i> an <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1362-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1362-1">p</a></sup></small>accident; he
    is not clean, undoubtedly <i class="calibre12">he is</i> not clean.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>But it came about the next day, the second <i
      class="calibre12">day</i> of the new moon, that David&rsquo;s place was empty <i class="calibre12">again;</i> so
    Saul
    said to his son Jonathan, &ldquo;Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>And Jonathan answered Saul, &ldquo;David earnestly
    requested
    leave of me <i class="calibre12">to go</i> to Bethlehem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>He said, &lsquo;Please let me go, because our family
    has a
    sacrifice in the city, and my brother has ordered me <i class="calibre12">to attend.</i> So now, if I have found
    favor in your sight, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.&rsquo; For this reason he has not come
    to the
    king&rsquo;s table.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Saul Is Angry with Jonathan</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Then Saul&rsquo;s anger burned against Jonathan, and he said
    to
    him, &ldquo;You son of a perverse, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you are choosing the son of Jesse to your
    own
    shame, and to the shame of your mother&rsquo;s nakedness?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>For, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1363-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1363-1">q</a></sup></small>as long as the
    son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established. Now then, send <i
      class="calibre12">men</i> and bring him to me, for he is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source1363-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1363-2">r</a></sup></small>doomed to
    die!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>But Jonathan replied to his father Saul and said to
    him, &ldquo;Why must he be put to death? What has he done?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike and kill
    him; so Jonathan knew that his father had decided to put David to death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Then Jonathan got up from the table in the heat of
    anger, and did not eat food on the second day of the new moon, because he was worried about David since his father
    had insulted him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">35</b></span> Now it came
    about in the morning that Jonathan went out to the field at the time agreed upon with David, and a little boy <i
      class="calibre12">was</i> with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>He said to his boy, &ldquo;Run, find now the arrows
    which I
    am about to shoot.&rdquo; The boy ran, and he shot <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1364-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1364-1">s</a></sup></small>an arrow past him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>When the boy reached the location of the arrow which
    Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the boy and said, &ldquo;Is the arrow not beyond you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Then Jonathan called after the boy, &ldquo;Hurry, be
    quick,
    do not stay!&rdquo; And Jonathan&rsquo;s boy picked up the arrow and came to his master.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan
    and David knew about the matter.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>Then Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to
    him, &ldquo;Go, bring <i class="calibre12">them</i> to the city.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>When the boy was gone, David got up from the south
    side, then he fell on his face to the ground and bowed three times. And they kissed each other and wept together,
    until David <i class="calibre12">wept</i> immeasurably.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>Then Jonathan said to David, &ldquo;Go <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1364-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1364-2">t</a></sup></small>in safety, since we have sworn to each other in the
    name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying, &lsquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will be between me
    and
    you, and between my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1364-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1364-3">u</a></sup></small>descendants and your <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1364-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1364-3">u</a></sup></small>descendants forever.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1364-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1364-4">v</a></sup></small>So <i class="calibre12">David</i> set out and went
