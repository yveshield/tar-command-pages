  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Philistines Take the Ark in Victory</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> So the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
    to meet the Philistines in battle, and they camped beside Ebenezer, while the Philistines camped in Aphek.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then the Philistines drew up in battle formation to meet
    Israel. When the battle <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1282-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1282-1">a</a></sup></small>spread, Israel was <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1282-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1282-2">b</a></sup></small>defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four
    thousand men on the battlefield.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>When the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel
    said, &ldquo;Why has the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> defeated us today before the Philistines? Let&rsquo;s take
    the
    ark of
    the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> from Shiloh, so that He may come among us and save us from the
    power of our enemies.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the people sent <i class="calibre12">men</i> to
    Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies who is
    enthroned <i class="calibre12">above</i> the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> there with the ark of the covenant of God.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> And as the ark
    of the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was coming into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great
    shout, so that the earth resounded.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout,
    they said, &ldquo;What <i class="calibre12">does</i> the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews <i
      class="calibre12">mean?</i>&rdquo; Then they understood that the ark of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had
    come
    into the camp.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So the Philistines were afraid, for they said,
    &ldquo;God has
    come into the camp!&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Woe to us! Who will save us from the hand of these
    mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all <i class="calibre12">kinds of</i> plagues in the
    wilderness.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Take courage and be men, Philistines, or you will become
    slaves to the Hebrews, as they have been slaves to you; so be men and fight!&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> So the
    Philistines fought and Israel was defeated, and every man fled to his tent; and the defeat was very great, for
    thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Moreover, the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of
    Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, died.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now a man of
    Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes torn, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1283-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1283-1">c</a></sup></small>dust on his head.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on <i
      class="calibre12">his</i> seat <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1283-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1283-2">d</a></sup></small>by the road keeping watch,
    because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. And the man came to give a report in the city, and all the city
    cried out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he said,
    &ldquo;What
    <i class="calibre12">does</i> the noise of this commotion <i class="calibre12">mean?</i>&rdquo; Then the man came
    hurriedly and told Eli.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1283-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1283-3">e</a></sup></small>fixed and he could not see.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>The man said to Eli, &ldquo;I am the one who came from
    the
    battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;How are things, my son?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then the one who brought the news replied,
    &ldquo;Israel has
    fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great defeat among the people, and your two sons, Hophni and
    Phinehas are also dead; and the ark of God has been taken.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>When he mentioned the ark of God, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1283-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1283-4">f</a></sup></small>Eli fell off the seat backward beside the gate, and
    his neck was broken and he died, for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1283-5"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1283-5">g</a></sup></small>he was old and heavy. And <i
      class="calibre12">so</i> he judged Israel for forty years.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> Now his
    daughter-in-law, Phinehas&rsquo; wife, was pregnant <i class="calibre12">and about</i> to give birth; and when she
    heard
    the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down
    and gave birth, because her pains came upon her.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And about the time of her death the women who were
    standing by her said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.&rdquo; But she did not
    answer or
    pay
    attention.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And she named the boy <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1284-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1284-1">h</a></sup></small>Ichabod, saying, &ldquo;The glory has departed from
    Israel,&rdquo; because the ark of God had been taken and because of her father-in-law and her husband.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So she said, &ldquo;The glory has departed from Israel,
    because the ark of God has been taken.&rdquo;
