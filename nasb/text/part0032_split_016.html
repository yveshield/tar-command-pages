    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And He had to pass through Samaria.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So He *came to a city of Samaria called Sychar, near the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>and Jacob&rsquo;s well was there. So Jesus, tired from

    &ldquo;Give Me a drink.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>For His disciples had gone away to the city to buy food.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So the Samaritan woman *said to Him, &ldquo;How <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Jesus replied to her, &ldquo;If you knew the gift of

    who it is who is saying to you, &lsquo;Give Me a drink,&rsquo; you would have asked Him, and He would have given you

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> The woman

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>The woman *said to Him, &ldquo;I know that Messiah is

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Jesus *said to her, &ldquo;I am <i

    the One speaking to you.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> And at this
    point His disciples came, and they were amazed that He had been speaking with a woman, yet no one said, &ldquo;What
    are
    You seeking?&rdquo; or, &ldquo;Why are You speaking with her?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So the woman left her waterpot and went into the city,
    and *said to the people,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>They left the city and were coming to Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Meanwhile the
    disciples were urging Him, saying, &ldquo;Rabbi, eat <i class="calibre12">something.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>But He said to them, &ldquo;I have food to eat that you
    do
    not know about.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>So the disciples were saying to one another, &ldquo;No

    brought Him <i class="calibre12">anything</i> to eat, did he?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;My food is to do the will

    who sent Me, and to accomplish His work.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Do you not say, &lsquo;There are still four months, and
    <i class="calibre12">then</i> comes the harvest&rsquo;? Behold, I tell you, raise your eyes and observe the fields,
    that
    they are white for harvest.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Already the one who reaps is receiving wages and is
    gathering fruit for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who reaps may rejoice together.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>For in this <i class="calibre12">case</i> the saying is
    true: &lsquo;One sows and another reaps.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Samaritans</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">39</b></span> Now from that city many of the Samaritans believed in Him
    because of the word of the woman who testified, &ldquo;He told me all the things that I have done.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>So when the Samaritans came to <small

    He stayed there two days.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>Many more believed because of His word;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>and they were saying to the woman, &ldquo;<i
      class="calibre12">It is</i> no longer because of what you said <i class="calibre12">that</i> we believe, for we
    have heard for ourselves and know that this One truly is the Savior of the world.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">43</b></span> And after the
    two days, He departed from there for Galilee.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor
    in his own country.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">45</sup></small>So when He came to Galilee, the Galileans received Him,
    <i class="calibre12">only because</i> they had seen all the things that He did in Jerusalem at the feast; for they
    themselves also went to the feast.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Healing an Official&rsquo;s Son</i></p>

    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">46</b></span> Therefore He came again to Cana of Galilee, where He had made
    the water <i class="calibre12">into</i> wine. And there was a royal official whose son was sick at Capernaum.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">47</sup></small>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea into
    Galilee, he went to Him and <i class="calibre12">began</i> asking <i class="calibre12">Him</i> to come down and heal
    his son; for he was at the point of death.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">48</sup></small>Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Unless you <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">49</sup></small>The royal official *said to Him, &ldquo;<small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>Jesus *said to him, &ldquo;Go; your son <small

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6539-3">p</a></sup></small>is alive.&rdquo; The man believed the word that
    Jesus
    spoke to him and went <i class="calibre12">home.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>And as he was now going down, his slaves met him,
    saying that his <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6539-4" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">52</sup></small>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get
    better. Then they said to him, &ldquo;Yesterday at the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    the fever left

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>So the father knew that <i class="calibre12">it was</i>
    at that hour in which Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Your son is alive&rdquo;; and he himself believed, and his entire

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">54</sup></small>This is again a second <small class="small1"><sup
