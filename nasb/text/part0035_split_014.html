  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Paul&rsquo;s Apostolic Ministry</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy,
    we do not lose heart,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>but we have renounced the things hidden because of
    shame, not walking in trickery nor distorting the word of God, but by the open proclamation of the truth commending
    ourselves to every person&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6974-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6974-1">a</a></sup></small>to those who are perishing,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>in whose case the god of this <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6974-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6974-2">b</a></sup></small>world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving so
    that <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6974-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6974-3">c</a></sup></small>they will not see the light of the gospel of the
    glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as
    Lord, and ourselves as your bond-servants <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6974-4"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6974-4">d</a></sup></small>on account of Jesus.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For God, who said, &ldquo;Light shall shine out of
    darkness,&rdquo;
    is the One who has shone in our hearts to give the Light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> But we have
    this treasure in <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6975-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6975-1">e</a></sup></small>earthen containers, so that the extraordinary <i
      class="calibre12">greatness</i> of the power will be of God and not from ourselves;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small><i class="calibre12">we are</i> afflicted in every way,
    but not crushed; perplexed, but not despairing;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not
    destroyed;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>always carrying around in the body the dying of Jesus,
    so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our body.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>For we who live are constantly being handed over to
    death because of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be revealed in our mortal flesh.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So death works in us, but life in you.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> But having
    the same spirit of faith, according to what is written: &ldquo;I <span class="small1">BELIEVED</span>, <span
      class="small1">THEREFORE</span> I <span class="small1">SPOKE</span>,&rdquo; we also believe, therefore we also
    speak,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also
    raise us with Jesus, and will present <i class="calibre12">us</i> with you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For all things <i class="calibre12">are</i> for your
    sakes, so that grace, having <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6976-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6976-1">f</a></sup></small>spread to more and more people, will cause
    thanksgiving to overflow to the glory of God.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Therefore we
    do not lose heart, but though our outer person is decaying, yet our inner <i class="calibre12">person</i> is being
    renewed day by day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For our momentary, light affliction is producing for us
    an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>while we look not at the things which are seen, but at
    the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are
    eternal.
