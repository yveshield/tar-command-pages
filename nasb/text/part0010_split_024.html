            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Now
            Samuel was
            dead, and all Israel had mourned him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums
            and
            spiritists from the land.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the Philistines assembled and came and camped
            in

            the Urim, or by the prophets.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then Saul said to his servants, &ldquo;Find for
            me a
            woman who
            is a medium, so that I may go to her and inquire of her.&rdquo; And his servants said to him, &ldquo;Behold,

            life, to bring about my death?&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So Saul swore an oath to her by the L<span

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But the king said to her, &ldquo;Do not be
