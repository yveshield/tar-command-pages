  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jehoshaphat Allies with Ahab</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Jehoshaphat had great riches and honor; and he allied
    himself by marriage to Ahab.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Some years later he went down to <i
      class="calibre12">visit</i> Ahab at Samaria, and Ahab slaughtered many sheep and oxen for him and the people who
    were with him. And he incited him to go up against Ramoth-gilead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Ahab king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
    &ldquo;Will you go with me <i class="calibre12">against</i> Ramoth-gilead?&rdquo; And he said to him, &ldquo;I am as
    you
    are, and my
    people as your people, and <i class="calibre12">we will be</i> with you in the battle.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> However,
    Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, &ldquo;Please request the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So the king of Israel assembled the <small

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2034-2">b</a></sup></small>prophets, four hundred men, and said to them,
    &ldquo;Should we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or should I refrain?&rdquo; And they said, &ldquo;Go up, for
    God will
    hand <i class="calibre12">it</i> over to the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;Is there no longer a
    prophet of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> here, that we may inquire of him?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;There
    is
    still one man by whom we may inquire of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, but I hate him, for he never
    prophesies <i class="calibre12">anything</i> good regarding me, but always bad. He is Micaiah the son of
    Imlah.&rdquo; But
    Jehoshaphat said, &ldquo;May the king not say so.&rdquo;

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Ahab&rsquo;s False Prophets Assure Victory</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said,
    &ldquo;Bring Micaiah son of Imlah quickly.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah
    were sitting, each on his throne, dressed in <i class="calibre12">their</i> robes, and <i class="calibre12">they</i>
    were sitting at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets were prophesying
    before them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made horns of iron
    for himself and said, &ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;With these you will gore
    the
    Arameans until they are destroyed!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>All the prophets were prophesying this as well, saying,
    &ldquo;Go up to Ramoth-gilead and be successful, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will hand <i

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Micaiah Brings Word from God</i></p>

    favorable to the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>But Micaiah said, &ldquo;As the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> When he came
    to the king, the king said to him, &ldquo;Micaiah, should we go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or should I
    refrain?&rdquo; He
    said, &ldquo;Go up and succeed, for they will be handed over to you!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then the king said to him, &ldquo;How many times must I
    make
    you swear that you will tell me nothing but the truth in the name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So he said,

  <div class="block">&ldquo;I saw all Israel </div>

  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;Did
    I not
    tell you that he would not prophesy <i class="calibre12">anything</i> good regarding me, but <i
      class="calibre12">only</i> bad?&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> And <i
      class="calibre12">Micaiah</i> said, &ldquo;Therefore, hear the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>. I saw
    the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said,

    Ramoth-gilead?&rsquo; And one <i class="calibre12">spirit</i> said this, while another said that.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> and said, &lsquo;I will <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    him.&rsquo;
    And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to him, &lsquo;How?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>He said, &lsquo;I will go out and be a deceiving spirit
    in
    the mouths of all his prophets.&rsquo; Then He said, &lsquo;You shall <small class="small1"><sup

    also prevail. Go out and do so.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Now therefore, behold, the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has put a deceiving spirit in the mouths of these prophets of yours, for the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has declared disaster against you.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> Then Zedekiah
    the son of Chenaanah approached and struck Micaiah on the cheek; and he said, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source2037-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2037-1">h</a></sup></small>How did the Spirit of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>And Micaiah said, &ldquo;Behold, you are going to see
    <i class="calibre12">how</i> on that day when you go <i class="calibre12">from one</i> inner room to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2037-2" epub:type="noteref"

    yourself.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then the king of Israel said, &ldquo;Take Micaiah and
    return
    him to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king&rsquo;s son;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>and say, &lsquo;This is what the king says: &ldquo;Put

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>But Micaiah said, &ldquo;If you actually return <small

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">28</b></span> So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah went up
    against Ramoth-gilead.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, &ldquo;I
    will
    disguise myself and go into battle, but you put on your robes.&rdquo; So the king of Israel disguised himself, and
    they
    went into battle.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Now the king of Aram had commanded the commanders of
    his chariots, saying, &ldquo;Do not fight with the small <i class="calibre12">or</i> great, but only with the king
    of
    Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>So when the commanders of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat,
    they said, &ldquo;He is the king of Israel!&rdquo; And they turned aside to fight against him. But Jehoshaphat cried
    out,
    and
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> helped him, and God diverted them from him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>When the commanders of the chariots saw that it was not

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Now one man drew his bow at random and struck the king
    of Israel <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2038-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2038-1">m</a></sup></small>in a joint of the armor. So he said to the driver of
    his chariot, &ldquo;Turn <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2038-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2038-2">n</a></sup></small>around and take me out of the battle, for I am
    severely wounded.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>The battle raged on that day, and the king of Israel
    propped himself up in his chariot in front of the Arameans until the evening; and at sunset he died.
