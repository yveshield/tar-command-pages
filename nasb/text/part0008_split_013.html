            the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Joshua, saying,
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Take for yourselves twelve men from the

            firmly, and
            carry them over with you and lay them down in the encampment where you will spend the

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>then you shall say to them, &lsquo;That the

            Israel did exactly as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, just as the
            L<span class="small1">ORD</span> spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of
            Israel; and they
            carried them over with them to the encampment and put them down there.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle

            commanded
            Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and
