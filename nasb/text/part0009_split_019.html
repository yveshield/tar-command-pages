            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then the sons of Dan said to him, &ldquo;Do not

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> Then
            they
            took what Micah had made and the priest who had belonged to him, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and
            unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burned the city with fire.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>And there was no one to save <i

            was in the
            valley which is near Beth-rehob. So they rebuilt the city and lived in it.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And they named the city Dan, after the name of

            their father who was born to Israel; however, the name of the city was previously Laish.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>The sons of Dan set up for themselves the
