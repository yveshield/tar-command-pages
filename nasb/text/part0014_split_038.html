  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Ahaz <i class="calibre12">was</i> twenty years old when he
    became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not do what was right in the sight of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> as his father David <i class="calibre12">had done.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>But he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel; he
    also made cast metal images for the Baals.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Furthermore, he burned incense in the Valley of
    Ben-hinnom, and burned his sons in fire, according to the abominations of the nations whom the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had driven out from the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>He sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on
    the hills, and under every green tree.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Judah Is Invaded</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Therefore the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> his God handed
    him over to the king of Aram; and they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2080-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2080-1">a</a></sup></small>defeated him and carried from
    him a great number of captives, and brought <i class="calibre12">them</i> to Damascus. And he was also handed over
    to the king of Israel, who struck him with heavy casualties.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>For Pekah the son of Remaliah killed 120,000 in Judah in
    one day, all valiant men, because they had abandoned the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God of their fathers.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, killed Maaseiah the
    king&rsquo;s son, Azrikam the ruler of the house, and Elkanah the second to the king.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> The sons of
    Israel led away captive two hundred thousand of their relatives, women, sons, and daughters; and they also <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2081-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2081-1">b</a></sup></small>took a great deal of spoils from them, and brought
    the spoils to Samaria.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But a prophet of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    was there, whose name <i class="calibre12">was</i> Oded; and he went out to meet the army which came to Samaria and
    said to them, &ldquo;Behold, because the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of your fathers, was angry with
    Judah,
    He has handed them over to you, and you have killed them in a rage <i class="calibre12">which</i> has even reached
    heaven.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now you are proposing to subjugate the people of Judah
    and Jerusalem as male and female slaves for yourselves. <i class="calibre12">Are</i> you not, however guilty
    yourselves of offenses against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> your God?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Now then, listen to me and return the captives whom you
    captured from your brothers, for the burning anger of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> is against you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then some of the leading men of the sons of
    Ephraim—Azariah the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the
    son of Hadlai—rose up against those who were coming from the battle,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>and said to them, &ldquo;You must not bring the
    captives in
    here, for you are proposing <i class="calibre12">to bring</i> guilt upon us before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, adding to our sins and our guilt; for our guilt is great, and <i
      class="calibre12">His</i> burning anger is against Israel.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So the armed men left the captives and the spoils
    before the officers and all the assembly.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then the men who were designated by name got up, took
    the captives, and they clothed all their naked people from the spoils; they gave them clothes and sandals, fed them
    and gave them drink, anointed them <i class="calibre12">with oil,</i> led all their feeble ones on donkeys, and
    brought them to Jericho, the city of palm trees, to their brothers; then they returned to Samaria.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Compromise with Assyria</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> At that time King Ahaz sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> to
    the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2082-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2082-1">c</a></sup></small>kings of Assyria for help.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For the Edomites had come again and attacked Judah, and
    led away captives.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>The Philistines had also invaded the cities of the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2082-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2082-2">d</a></sup></small>lowland and of the Negev of Judah, and had taken
    Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, and Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages;
    and they had settled there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>For the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had humbled
    Judah because of Ahaz king of Israel, for he had brought about a lack of restraint in Judah and was very unfaithful
    to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>So Tilgath-pilneser king of Assyria came against him
    and afflicted him instead of strengthening him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Although Ahaz took a portion out of the house of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and out of the palace of the king and of the princes, and gave <i
      class="calibre12">it</i> to the king of Assyria, it did not help him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> Now during
    the time of his distress, this same King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>For he sacrificed to the gods of Damascus who had
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2083-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2083-1">e</a></sup></small>defeated him, and said, &ldquo;Because the gods of
    the
    kings of Aram helped them, I will sacrifice to them so that they may help me.&rdquo; But they became the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2083-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2083-2">f</a></sup></small>downfall of him and all Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Moreover, when Ahaz gathered together the utensils of
    the house of God, he cut the utensils of the house of God in pieces; and he closed the doors of the house of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and made altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>In every city of Judah he made high places to burn
    incense to other gods, and provoked the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of his fathers, to anger.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Now the rest of his acts and all his ways, from the
    first to the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>So Ahaz <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source2083-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0015_split_007.html#f2083-3">g</a></sup></small>lay down with
    his fathers, and they buried him in the city, in Jerusalem, for they did not bring him to the tombs of the kings of
    Israel; and his son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
