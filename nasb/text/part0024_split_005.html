  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The word that came to Jeremiah from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Hear the words of this covenant, and speak to the
    men
    of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and say to them, &lsquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel says: &ldquo;Cursed is the one who does not obey the words of this
    covenant
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>which I commanded your forefathers on the day that I
    brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, &lsquo;Listen to My voice, and <small

          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4868-1">a</a></sup></small>do according to all that I command you; so you shall

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>in order to confirm the oath which I swore to your
    forefathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as <i class="calibre12">it is</i> this
    day.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Then I replied, &ldquo;Amen, L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> And the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> said to me, &ldquo;Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of
    Jerusalem, saying, &lsquo;Hear the words of this covenant and do them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>For I solemnly warned your fathers on the day I brought
    them up from the land of Egypt, even to this day, warning <i class="calibre12">them</i> persistently, saying,
    &ldquo;Listen to My voice.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Yet they did not obey or incline their ear, but walked
    in the stubbornness of their evil heart, each one <i class="calibre12">of them;</i> therefore I brought on them all
    the words of this covenant which I commanded <i class="calibre12">them</i> to do, but they did
    not.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me, &ldquo;A conspiracy has been found among the men of Judah and among the

    have followed other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken My covenant which I
    made with their fathers.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Therefore this is what the L<span

    escape;
    though they will cry out to Me, I will not listen to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then the cities of Judah and the inhabitants of
    Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
