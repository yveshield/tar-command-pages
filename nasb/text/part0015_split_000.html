    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Hezekiah became king <i class="calibre12">when he was</i>
    twenty-five years old; and he reigned for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. And his mother&rsquo;s name <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He did what was right in the sight of the L<span

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> In the first
    year of his reign, in the first month, he opened the doors of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and

    extinguished the lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings in the holy place to the God of
    Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Therefore the wrath of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was against Judah and Jerusalem, and He has made them an object of terror, of horror,
    and of hissing, as you see with your own eyes.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For behold, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and
    our sons, our daughters, and our wives are in captivity because of this.

    days, and finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then they went in to King Hezekiah and said, &ldquo;We
    have
    cleansed the whole house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils,
    and the table of the showbread with all of its utensils.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Moreover, all the utensils which King Ahaz had
    discarded during his reign in his unfaithfulness, we have prepared and consecrated; and behold, they are before the

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Hezekiah Restores Temple Worship</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Then King Hezekiah got up early and assembled the princes of
    the city, and went up to the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and
    seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, the sanctuary, and Judah. And he ordered the priests, the sons
    of Aaron, to offer <i class="calibre12">them</i> on the altar of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So they slaughtered the bulls, and the priests took the
    blood and sprinkled it on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar; they
    slaughtered the lambs as well, and sprinkled the blood on the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Then they brought the male goats of the sin offering
    before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>The priests slaughtered them and purified the altar
    with their blood to atone for all Israel, because the king ordered the burnt offering and the sin offering for all
    Israel.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> He then
    stationed the Levites in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with cymbals, harps, and lyres, according
    to the command of David and of Gad, the king&rsquo;s seer, and of Nathan the prophet; for the command was from the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> through His prophets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>The Levites stood with the <i
      class="calibre12">musical</i> instruments of David, and the priests with the trumpets.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Then Hezekiah gave the order to offer the burnt
    offering on the altar. When the burnt offering began, the song to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> <i
      class="calibre12">also</i> began with the trumpets, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>While the whole assembly worshiped, the singers also
    sang and the trumpets sounded; all this <i class="calibre12">continued</i> until the burnt offering was finished.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">29</b></span> Now at the
    completion of the burnt offerings, the king and all who were present with him bowed down and worshiped.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the
    Levites to sing praises to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> with the words of David and Asaph the seer. So they
    sang praises with joy, and bowed down and worshiped.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Then Hezekiah
    said, &ldquo;Now <i class="calibre12">that</i> you have <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    offerings.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>The number of the burnt offerings which the assembly
    brought was seventy bulls, a hundred rams, and two hundred lambs; all of these were for a burnt offering to the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>The consecrated <i class="calibre12">offerings</i> were
    six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>But the priests were too few, so that they were unable
    to skin all the burnt offerings; therefore their brothers the Levites helped them until the work was finished and
    the <i class="calibre12">other</i> priests had consecrated themselves. For the Levites were more <small

    offerings and the drink offerings for the burnt offerings. So the service of the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was established <i class="calibre12">again.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Then Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced over what God
    had prepared for the people, because the thing came about suddenly.
