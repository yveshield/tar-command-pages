  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Reaffirm Your Love</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> But I decided this <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6968-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6968-1">a</a></sup></small>for my own sake, that I would not come to you in
    sorrow again.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>For if I cause you sorrow, who then <i
      class="calibre12">will be</i> the one making me glad but the one who is made sorrowful by me?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>This is the very thing I wrote you, so that when I came,
    I would not have sorrow from those who ought to make me rejoice; having confidence in you all that my joy was <i
      class="calibre12">the joy</i> of you all.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote
    to you with many tears; not so that you would be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have
    especially for you.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> But if anyone
    has caused sorrow, he has caused sorrow not for me, but in some degree—<small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6969-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6969-1">b</a></sup></small>not to say too much—for all of you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Sufficient for such a person is this punishment which <i
      class="calibre12">was imposed</i> by the majority,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>so that on the other hand, you should rather forgive and
    comfort <i class="calibre12">him,</i> otherwise such a person might be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Therefore I urge you to reaffirm <i
      class="calibre12">your</i> love for him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For to this end I also wrote, so that I might <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6969-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6969-2">c</a></sup></small>put you to the test, whether you are obedient in all
    things.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But one whom you forgive anything, I also <i
      class="calibre12">forgive;</i> for indeed what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, <i
      class="calibre12">I did so</i> for your sakes in the presence of Christ,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>so that no advantage would be taken of us by Satan, for
    we are not ignorant of his schemes.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Now when I
    came to Troas for the gospel of Christ and when a door was opened for me in the Lord,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>I had no rest for my spirit, not finding Titus my
    brother; but saying goodbye to them, I went on to Macedonia.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> But thanks be
    to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us reveals the fragrance of the knowledge of Him in
    every place.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who
    are being saved and among those who are perishing:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>to the one an <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6970-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6970-1">d</a></sup></small>aroma from death to death, to the other an aroma
    from life to life. And who is adequate for these things?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For we are not like the many, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6970-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6970-2">e</a></sup></small>peddling the word of God, but as from sincerity, but
    as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God.
