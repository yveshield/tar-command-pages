    man clothed in linen with a scribe&rsquo;s kit at his waist. And they came in and stood beside the bronze altar.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Then the glory
    of the God of Israel ascended from the cherub on which it had been, to the threshold of the <small

    whose waist was the scribe&rsquo;s kit.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to him,
    &ldquo;Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem, and make a mark on the foreheads of the
