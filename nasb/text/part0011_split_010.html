  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Ziba, a False Servant</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now when David had gone on a little beyond the summit, behold,
    Ziba the servant of Mephibosheth met him with a team of saddled donkeys, and on them <i class="calibre12">were</i>
    two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred cakes of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And the king said to Ziba, &ldquo;Why do you have
    these?&rdquo; And
    Ziba said, &ldquo;The donkeys are for the king&rsquo;s household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for the
    young men
    to
    eat, and the wine, for whoever is weary in the wilderness to drink.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the king said, &ldquo;And where is your
    master&rsquo;s
    son?&rdquo;
    And Ziba said to the king, &ldquo;Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, &lsquo;Today the house of Israel
    will
    restore
    the kingdom of my father to me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the king said to Ziba, &ldquo;Behold, all that
    belongs to
    Mephibosheth is yours.&rdquo; And Ziba said, &ldquo;I prostrate myself; may I find favor in your sight, my lord, the
    king!&rdquo;

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Is Cursed</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> When King David came to Bahurim, behold, a man was coming out
    from there from the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Shimei, the son of Gera; he was coming out,
    cursing as he came.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He also threw stones at David and all the servants of
    King David; and all the people and all the warriors were on his right and on his left.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>This is what Shimei said when he cursed: &ldquo;Go away,
    go
    away, you man of bloodshed and worthless man!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has brought back
    upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have become king; and the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has handed the kingdom over to your son Absalom. And behold, you are <i
      class="calibre12">caught</i> in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then Abishai
    the son of Zeruiah said to the king, &ldquo;Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Now let me go over and
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1490-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1490-1">a</a></sup></small>cut off his head.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But the king said, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1490-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1490-2">b</a></sup></small>What <i class="calibre12">business</i> of mine is
    yours, you sons of Zeruiah? If he curses, and if the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has told him, &lsquo;Curse
    David,&rsquo;
    then who should say, &lsquo;Why have you done so?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants,
    &ldquo;Behold, my son who came out of my own body seeks my life; how much more now <i class="calibre12">this</i>
    Benjaminite? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has told him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Perhaps the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will look
    on my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1490-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1490-3">c</a></sup></small>misery and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1490-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1490-4">d</a></sup></small>return good to me instead of his cursing this
    day.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei kept
    going on the hillside close beside him, and as he went he cursed and threw stones and dirt at him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And the king and all the people who were with him
    arrived exhausted, and he refreshed himself there.

  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Absalom Enters Jerusalem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered
    Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Now it came about, when Hushai the Archite,
    David&rsquo;s
    friend, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">Long</i> live the king! <i
      class="calibre12">Long</i> live the king!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>But Absalom said to Hushai, &ldquo;Is this your <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1491-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1491-1">e</a></sup></small>loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your
    friend?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>So Hushai said to Absalom, &ldquo;No! For whomever the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, this people, and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I shall be, and with him I
    shall remain.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Besides, whom should I serve? <i
      class="calibre12">Should I</i> not <i class="calibre12">serve</i> in the presence of his son? Just as I have
    served in your father&rsquo;s presence, so I shall be in your presence.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Then Absalom
    said to Ahithophel, &ldquo;Give your advice. What should we do?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Ahithophel said to Absalom, &ldquo;Have relations with
    your
    father&rsquo;s concubines, whom he has left behind to take care of the house; then all Israel will hear that you
    have made
    yourself repulsive to your father. The hands of all who are with you will also be strengthened.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof, and
    Absalom had relations with his father&rsquo;s concubines in the sight of all Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Now the advice of Ahithophel, which he <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1492-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0011_split_018.html#f1492-1">f</a></sup></small>gave in those days, <i class="calibre12">was
      taken</i> as though one inquired of the word of God; so <i class="calibre12">was</i> all the advice of Ahithophel
    <i class="calibre12">regarded</i> by both David and Absalom.
