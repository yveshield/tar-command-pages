    with consideration and allowed him to go to his friends and receive care.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>From there we put out to sea and sailed under the
    shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>When we had sailed through the sea along the coast of
    Cilicia and Pamphylia, we landed at Myra in Lycia.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing
    for Italy, and he put us aboard it.

    difficulty had arrived off Cnidus, since the wind did not permit us <i class="calibre12">to go</i> farther, we
    sailed under the shelter of Crete, off Salmone;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>and with difficulty sailing past it, we came to a place
    called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.

    will
    certainly be with damage and great loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>But the centurion was more persuaded by the pilot and

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>The harbor was not suitable for wintering, so the
    majority reached a decision to put out to sea from there, if somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete

          href="part0034_split_010.html#f6794-3">q</a></sup></small>prayed for daybreak.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>But as the sailors were trying to escape from the ship
    and had let down the <i class="calibre12">ship&rsquo;s</i> boat into the sea, on the pretense that they were going
    to lay
    out anchors from the bow,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers,
    &ldquo;Unless
    these men remain on the ship, you yourselves cannot be saved.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the <i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">33</b></span> Until the day
    was about to dawn, Paul kept encouraging them all to take some food, saying, &ldquo;Today is the fourteenth day that
    you
    have been constantly watching and going without eating, having taken in nothing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>Therefore, I encourage you to take some food, for this
    is for your survival, for not a hair from the head of any of you will perish.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Having said this, he took bread and gave thanks to God
    in the presence of them all, and he broke it and began to eat.

    bay with a beach, and they resolved to run the ship onto it if they could.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>And casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea
    while at the same time they were loosening the ropes of the rudders; and they hoisted the foresail to the wind and
    were heading for the beach.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>But they struck a <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>The soldiers&rsquo; plan was to kill the prisoners, so

    through, kept them from <i class="calibre12">accomplishing</i> their intention, and commanded that those who could
