            appeared above them.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And He spoke to the man clothed in linen and

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> Now
            the

            was filled with the brightness of the glory of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Moreover, the sound of the wings of the cherubim

            came

            the
