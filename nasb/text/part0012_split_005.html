    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam became sick.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And Jeroboam said to his wife, &ldquo;Now arise and
    disguise
    yourself so that they will not know that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet
    is there, who said regarding me <i class="calibre12">that I would be</i> king over this people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Take ten loaves with you, <i class="calibre12">some</i>
    pastries, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> And
    Jeroboam&rsquo;s
    wife did so, and set out and went to Shiloh, and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see because his

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had said to
    Ahijah, &ldquo;Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> So when Ahijah
    heard the sound of her feet coming in the doorway, he said, &ldquo;Come in, wife of Jeroboam; why do you make
    yourself
    unrecognizable? Nevertheless, I am sent to you <i class="calibre12">with</i> a harsh <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Go, say to Jeroboam, &lsquo;This is what the L<span

    leader over My people Israel,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and
    gave it to you—yet you have not been like My servant David, who kept My commandments and followed Me with all his
    heart, to do only that which was right in My sight;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>you also have done more evil than all who were before
    you, and you have gone and made for yourself other gods and cast metal images to provoke Me to anger, and have
    thrown Me behind your back—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>therefore behold, I am bringing disaster on the house
    of Jeroboam, and I will eliminate from Jeroboam <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1642-1"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city, the

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Then
    Jeroboam&rsquo;s wife arose and departed, and came to Tirzah. As she was entering the threshold of the house, the
    child
    died.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then all Israel buried him and mourned for him, in
    accordance with the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which He had spoken through His servant Ahijah the

      class="calibre12">as for</i> the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he made war and how he reigned, behold, they
    are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And the time that Jeroboam reigned <i
