    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>In the same way then, there has also come to be at the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>For if their rejection <i class="calibre12">proves to

      class="calibre12">be</i> but life from the dead?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>If the first piece <i class="calibre12">of dough</i> is
    holy, the lump is also; and if the root is holy, the branches are as well.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> But if some
    of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive, were grafted in among them and became partaker with
    them of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6865-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0034_split_026.html#f6865-1">j</a></sup></small>rich root of the olive tree,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>do not be arrogant toward the branches; but if you are
    arrogant, <i class="calibre12">remember that</i> it is not you who supports the root, but the root <i
      class="calibre12">supports</i> you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>You will say then, &ldquo;Branches were broken off so
    that I
    might be grafted in.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Quite right, they were broken off for their unbelief,
    but you stand by your faith. Do not be conceited, but fear;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>for if God did not spare the natural branches, He will
    not spare you, either.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>See then the kindness and severity of God: to those who
    fell, severity, but to you, God&rsquo;s kindness, if you continue in His kindness; for otherwise you too will be cut
    off.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And they also, if they do not continue in their
    unbelief, will be grafted in; for God is able to graft them in again.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild
    olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these who are the
    natural <i class="calibre12">branches</i> be grafted into their own olive tree?

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> For I do not
    want you, brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> to be uninformed of this mystery—so that you will not be
    wise in your own estimation—that a partial hardening has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has
    come in;
