            her
            royal robes and stood in the inner courtyard of the king&rsquo;s palace in front of the king&rsquo;s <small

            the
            courtyard, she obtained favor in his sight; and the king extended to Esther the golden scepter which <i

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the king said to her, &ldquo;What is <i

            king
            and Haman came to the banquet which Esther had prepared.

            was
            filled with

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Haman controlled himself, however, and went to
