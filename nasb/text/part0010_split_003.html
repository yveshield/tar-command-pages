            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So the sons of Israel removed the Baals and the

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then
            Samuel
            said, &ldquo;Gather all Israel to Mizpah and I will pray to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> for
            you.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So they gathered to Mizpah, and drew water and
            poured it
            out before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and fasted on that day and said there, &ldquo;We have
            sinned against the

            when the

            against
            Israel. And when the sons of Israel heard <i class="calibre12">about it,</i> they were afraid of the
            Philistines.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So the sons of Israel said to Samuel, &ldquo;Do

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Now Samuel was offering up the burnt offering,
            and the
            Philistines advanced to battle Israel. But the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> thundered with a great

            confused them, so that they were struck down before Israel.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and
            pursued
            the Philistines, and killed them as far as below Beth-car.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then
            Samuel

            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So the Philistines were subdued, and they did
            not come
            anymore within the border of Israel. And the hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was against the
            Philistines all the days of Samuel.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>The cities which the Philistines had taken from

            were restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and Israel <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
