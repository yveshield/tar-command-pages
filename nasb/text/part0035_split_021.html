    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> I wish that you would bear with me in a little foolishness;
    but <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6995-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>For I am jealous for you with a godly jealousy; for I
    betrothed you to one husband, to present you <i class="calibre12">as</i> a pure virgin to Christ.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For I consider myself not in the least inferior to the

    you in all things.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Or did I
    commit a sin by humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you without
