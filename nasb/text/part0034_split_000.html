    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> After these <i class="calibre12">events Paul</i> left Athens
    and went to Corinth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus
    having recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome.
    He came to them,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and because he was of the same trade he stayed with
    them, and they worked <i class="calibre12">together,</i> for they were tent-makers by trade.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">Paul</i> was reasoning in the
    synagogue every Sabbath and trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.

    and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul <i class="calibre12">began</i> devoting himself completely to the word,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the
    Lord together with his entire household; and many of the Corinthians, as they listened <i class="calibre12">to
      Paul,</i> were believing and being baptized.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And the Lord said to Paul by a vision at night,
    &ldquo;Do not
    be afraid <i class="calibre12">any longer,</i> but go on speaking and do not be silent;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm
    you, for I have many people in this city.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And he settled <i class="calibre12">there</i> for a
    year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> But while
    Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said
    to the Jews, &ldquo;If it were <i class="calibre12">a matter of</i> some crime or vicious, unscrupulous act, O Jews,
    it
    would be reasonable for me to put up with you;

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And he drove them away from the <small

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">18</b></span> Now Paul,
    when he had remained many days longer, took leave of the brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters</i> and sailed
    away to Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>When they asked him to stay for a longer time, he did
    not consent,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>but took leave of them and said, &ldquo;I will return
    to you
    again if God wills,&rdquo; and he set sail from Ephesus.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> When he had
    landed in Caesarea, he went up <i class="calibre12">to Jerusalem</i> and greeted the church, and went down to
