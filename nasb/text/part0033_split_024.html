    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Therefore, after being sent on their way by the church,
    they were passing through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and they

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were received by

    them the Holy Spirit, just as He also did to us;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>and He made no distinction between us and them,
    cleansing their hearts by faith.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Since this <i class="calibre12">is the</i> case, why
    are you putting God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor
