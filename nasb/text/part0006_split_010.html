    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the
    Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman);
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>and they said, &ldquo;Is it a fact that the L<span

    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> heard <i class="calibre12">this.</i>

    who was on the face of the earth.)
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> suddenly said
    to Moses and to Aaron and Miriam, &ldquo;You three go out to the tent of meeting.&rdquo; So the three of them went
    out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came down in a
    pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the tent; and He called Aaron and Miriam. When they had both come
    forward,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>He said,

  <p class="aleft"><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> And the anger of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But when the cloud had withdrawn from above the tent,
    behold, Miriam <i class="calibre12">was</i> leprous, as <i class="calibre12">white as</i> snow. As Aaron turned
    toward Miriam, behold, she <i class="calibre12">was</i> leprous.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Then Aaron said to Moses, &ldquo;Oh, my lord, I beg

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So Miriam was shut outside the camp for seven days, and
    the people did not move on until Miriam was received again.
