            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>The Philistine also said to David, &ldquo;Come

            army of
            the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth, so that all the earth
            may know
            that there is a God in Israel,

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">48</b></span> Then
            it
            happened, when the Philistine <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1347-1"

            to meet David, that David ran quickly
            toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">49</sup></small>And David put his hand into his bag and took
            from it a
            stone and slung <i class="calibre12">it,</i> and struck the Philistine on his forehead. And the stone
            penetrated his
            forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">50</b></span> So
            David
            prevailed over the Philistine with the sling and the stone: he struck the Philistine and killed him, and
            there was
            no sword in David&rsquo;s hand.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine,
            and took
            his sword and drew it out of its sheath and finished him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines
            saw
            that their champion was dead, they fled.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">52</sup></small>Then the men of Israel and Judah rose up and
            shouted,
            and they pursued the Philistines <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1348-1"

            the way to Shaaraim,
            even to Gath and Ekron.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>Then the sons of Israel returned from their
            close
            pursuit of the Philistines, and plundered their camps.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">54</sup></small>And David took the Philistine&rsquo;s head and
            brought it to
            Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.

            <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">55</b></span> Now
            when Saul
            had seen David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the commander of the army, &ldquo;Abner,
            whose son is
            this young man?&rdquo; And Abner said, &ldquo;By your life, O king, I do not know.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">56</sup></small>And the king said, &ldquo;You <i

            ask whose son the youth is.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">57</sup></small>So when David returned from killing the
            Philistine,
            Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the Philistine&rsquo;s head in his hand.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">58</sup></small>Then Saul said to him, &ldquo;Whose son are
            you, young man?&rdquo;
            And David answered, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">I am</i> the son of your servant Jesse the
