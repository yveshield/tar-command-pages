    Israel
    came up against Judah and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source2030-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then Asa brought out silver and gold from the treasuries
    of the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and the king&rsquo;s house, and sent it to Ben-hadad king of
    Aram,
    who lived in Damascus, saying,

    between my father and your father. Behold, I have sent you silver and gold; go, break your treaty with Baasha king
    of Israel so that he will withdraw from me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa, and he sent the

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Asa Imprisons the Prophet</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> At that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah and
    said to him, &ldquo;Because you have relied on the king of Aram and have not relied on the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God, for that reason the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your hand.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubim an immense army
    with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet because you relied on the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, He handed them
    over to you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>For the eyes of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    roam throughout the earth, so that He may strongly support those whose heart is completely His. You have acted
    foolishly in this. Indeed, from now on you will have wars.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Asa was angry with the seer and put him in <small

          href="part0015_split_007.html#f2031-1">g</a></sup></small>prison, for he was enraged at him for this. And Asa
    mistreated some of the people at the same time.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now, the acts
    of Asa <i class="calibre12">from</i> the first to the last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of
    Judah and Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>In the thirty-ninth year of his reign Asa became
    diseased in his feet. His disease was severe, yet even in his disease he did not seek the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So Asa <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    his fathers, and died in the forty-first year of his reign.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>They buried him in his own tomb which he had cut out
    for himself in the city of David, and they laid him in the resting place which he had filled with spices of various
    kinds blended by the perfumers&rsquo; art; and they made a very great fire for him.
