  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> In the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of
    Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Take a <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source4995-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4995-1">a</a></sup></small>scroll and
    write on it all the words which I have spoken to you concerning Israel, Judah, and all the nations, from the day I
    <i class="calibre12">first</i> spoke to you, from the days of Josiah, even to this day.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Perhaps the house of Judah will listen to all the
    disaster which I plan to carry out against them, so that every person will turn from his evil way; then I will
    forgive their wrongdoing and their sin.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Then Jeremiah
    called Baruch the son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote on a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source4996-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-1">b</a></sup></small>scroll <small

    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which He had spoken to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Jeremiah then commanded Baruch, saying, &ldquo;I am
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4996-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-3">d</a></sup></small>restricted; I cannot go into the house of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So you go and read from the scroll, which you have
    written <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4996-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-4">e</a></sup></small>at my dictation, the words of the L<span

          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-5">f</a></sup></small>to the people at the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> house on a day of fasting. And you shall also read
    them
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4996-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-5">f</a></sup></small>to all <i class="calibre12">the people of</i> Judah
    who come from their cities.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Perhaps their pleading will <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source4996-7" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4996-6">g</a></sup></small>come before the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    and everyone will turn from his evil way; for great is the anger and the wrath that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> has pronounced against this people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>So Baruch the son of Neriah acted in accordance with all
    that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading from the book the words of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> house.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Now in the
    fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem and all
    the people who came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem proclaimed a fast before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then Baruch read to all the people from the book the
    words of Jeremiah in the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan
    the scribe, in the upper courtyard, at the entry of the New Gate of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span
      class="small1">S</span> house.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Now when
    Micaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard all the words of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    from the book,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>he went down to the king&rsquo;s house, into the
    scribe&rsquo;s
    chamber. And behold, all the officials were sitting there—Elishama the scribe, Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, Elnathan
    the son of Achbor, Gemariah the son of Shaphan, Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the <i
      class="calibre12">other</i> officials.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And Micaiah declared to them all the words that he had
    heard when Baruch read from the book to the people.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Then all the officials sent Jehudi the son of
    Nethaniah, <i class="calibre12">who was</i> the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, &ldquo;Take
    in your
    hand the scroll from which you have read to the people and come.&rdquo; So Baruch the son of Neriah took the scroll
    in his
    hand and came to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And they said to him, &ldquo;Sit down, please, and read
    it to
    us.&rdquo; So Baruch read it to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>When they had heard all the words, they turned in fear
    one to another. And they said to Baruch, &ldquo;We will certainly report all these words to the king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Then they asked Baruch, saying, &ldquo;Tell us, please,
    how
    did you write all these words? <i class="calibre12">Was it</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source4997-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0025_split_016.html#f4997-1">h</a></sup></small>at
    Jeremiah&rsquo;s
    dictation?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>And Baruch said to them, &ldquo;He dictated all these
    words
    to me, and I wrote them with ink on the book.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Then the officials said to Baruch, &ldquo;Go, hide
    yourself,
    you and Jeremiah, and do not let anyone know where you are.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Scroll Is Burned</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> So they came to the king in the courtyard, but they had
    deposited the scroll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and they reported all the words to the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he
    took it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read it to the king as well as to all the officials
    who were standing beside the king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Now the king was sitting in the winter house in the
    ninth month, with <i class="calibre12">a fire</i> burning in the brazier before him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And when Jehudi had read three or four columns, <i
      class="calibre12">the king</i> cut it with a scribe&rsquo;s knife and threw <i class="calibre12">it</i> into the
    fire
    that was in the brazier, until all of the scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Yet the king and all his servants who heard all these
    words did not tremble in fear, nor did they tear their garments.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the
    king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And the king commanded Jerahmeel the king&rsquo;s son,
    Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> hid them.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Scroll Is Replaced</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">27</b></span> Then the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to
    Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words which Baruch had written <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source4998-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4998-1">i</a></sup></small>at the dictation of Jeremiah, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>&ldquo;Take again another scroll and write on it all
    the
    previous words that were on the first scroll, which Jehoiakim the king of Judah burned.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah you shall say,
    &lsquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;You have burned this scroll, saying,
    &lsquo;Why have you
    written
    on it <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source4998-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0025_split_016.html#f4998-2">j</a></sup></small>that the king of Babylon will certainly come and
    destroy this land, and will make mankind and animals disappear from it?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>Therefore this is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah: &ldquo;He shall have no one to sit on the
    throne of
    David, and his dead body shall be thrown out to the heat of the day and the frost of the night.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>I will also punish him, his <small class="small1"><sup

    and I will bring on them and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the people of Judah all the disaster that I have
    declared to them—but they did not listen.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">32</b></span> Then Jeremiah
    took another scroll and gave it to the scribe Baruch the son of Neriah, and he wrote on it at the <small
