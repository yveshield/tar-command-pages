            grapes.
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Now Pharaoh&rsquo;s cup was in my hand; so I

            the

            eating them out of the basket on my head.&rdquo;
            <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Then Joseph answered and said, &ldquo;This is
            its
