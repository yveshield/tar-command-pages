  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Melchizedek&rsquo;s Priesthood like Christ&rsquo;s</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High
    God, who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth of all <i
      class="calibre12">the spoils,</i> was first of all, by the translation <i class="calibre12">of his name,</i> king
    of righteousness, and then also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Without father, without mother, without genealogy,
    having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">4</b></span> Now observe
    how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And those indeed of the sons of Levi who receive the
    priest&rsquo;s office have a commandment <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-1">a</a></sup></small>in the Law to collect <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-2">b</a></sup></small>a tenth from the people, that is, from their
    countrymen, although they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-3">c</a></sup></small>are descended from Abraham.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them
    collected <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-4">d</a></sup></small>a tenth from Abraham and <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-5">e</a></sup></small>blessed the one who had the promises.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>But without any dispute the lesser <i
      class="calibre12">person</i> is blessed by the greater.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>In this case mortal men receive tithes, but in that case
    one <i class="calibre12">receives them,</i> of whom it is witnessed that he lives <i class="calibre12">on.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And, so to speak, through Abraham even Levi, who
    received tithes, has paid tithes,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>for he was still in the loins of his <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7194-6" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7194-6">f</a></sup></small>forefather when Melchizedek met him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> So if
    perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for on the basis of it the people received the Law), what further
    need <i class="calibre12">was there</i> for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek, and not
    be designated according to the order of Aaron?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>For when the priesthood is changed, of necessity there
    takes place a change of law also.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>For the one about whom these things are said belongs to
    another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For it is evident that our Lord <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7195-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7195-1">g</a></sup></small>was descended from Judah, a tribe with reference to
    which Moses said nothing concerning priests.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And this is clearer still, if another priest arises
    according to the likeness of Melchizedek,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>who has become <i class="calibre12">a priest</i> not on
    the basis of a law of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7195-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7195-2">h</a></sup></small>physical requirement, but according to the power of
    an indestructible life.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For it is attested <i class="calibre12">of Him,</i>
  </p>
  <div class="block">&ldquo;Y<span class="small1">OU ARE A PRIEST FOREVER</span> </div>
  <div class="block">A<span class="small1">CCORDING TO THE ORDER OF</span> M<span
      class="small1">ELCHIZEDEK</span>.&rdquo;
  </div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>For, on the one hand, there is <i
      class="calibre12">the</i> nullification of a former commandment because of its weakness and uselessness
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>(for the Law made nothing perfect); on the other hand,
    <i class="calibre12">there is the</i> introduction of a better hope, through which we come near to God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And to the extent that <i class="calibre12">it was</i>
    not without an oath
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>(for they indeed became priests without an oath, but He
    with an oath through the One who said to Him,

  </div>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>by the same extent Jesus also has become the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7195-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7195-3">i</a></sup></small>guarantee of a better covenant.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">23</b></span> <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7196-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7196-1">j</a></sup></small>The <i class="calibre12">former</i> priests, on the
    one hand, existed in greater numbers because they were prevented by death from continuing;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small><small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source7196-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0036_split_037.html#f7196-2">k</a></sup></small>Jesus, on the
    other hand, because He continues forever, holds His priesthood permanently.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Therefore He is also able to save <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source7196-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0036_split_037.html#f7196-3">l</a></sup></small>forever those who come to God through Him, since He
    always lives to make intercession for them.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> For it was
    fitting for us to have such a high priest, holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and exalted above the
    heavens;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>who has no daily need, like those high priests, to
    offer up sacrifices, first for His own sins and then for the <i class="calibre12">sins</i> of the people, because He
    did this once for all <i class="calibre12">time</i> when He offered up Himself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>For the Law appoints men as high priests who are weak,
    but the word of the oath, which came after the Law, <i class="calibre12">appoints</i> a Son, who has been made
    perfect forever.
