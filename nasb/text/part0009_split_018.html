    &ldquo;Blessed
    be my son by the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>He then returned the 1,100 <i

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So when he returned the silver to his mother, his mother
    took two hundred <i class="calibre12">pieces</i> of silver and gave them to the silversmith, who made <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did
    what was right in his own eyes.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now there was
    a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was <small class="small1"><sup

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then the man left the city, Bethlehem in Judah, to

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young
