    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to
    me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>&ldquo;Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of
    Israel, and prophesy against them
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>and say, &lsquo;Mountains of Israel, listen to the word
    of the
    Lord <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5220-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5220-1">a</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span>! This is what the

          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5220-1">a</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span> says to the
    mountains, the hills, the ravines, and the valleys: &ldquo;Behold, I Myself am going to bring a sword against you,
    and I
    will destroy your high places.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>So your altars will become deserted and your incense
    altars will be smashed; and I will make your slain fall in front of your idols.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>I will also lay the dead bodies of the sons of Israel in
    front of their idols; and I will scatter your bones around your altars.

    live, cities will be in ruins and the high places will be deserted, so that your altars will be in ruins and <small

          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5220-3">c</a></sup></small>deserted, your idols will be broken and brought to
    an end, your incense altars will be cut down, and your works wiped out.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The slain will fall among you, and you will know that I
    am the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.

    &ldquo;However, I
    will leave a remnant, in that you will have those who escaped the sword among the nations when you are scattered
    among the countries.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then those of you who escape will remember Me among the
    nations to which they will be taken captive, how I have <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source5221-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0027_split_013.html#f5221-1">d</a></sup></small>been hurt by
    their adulterous hearts which turned away from Me, and by their eyes which committed infidelity with their idols;
    and they will loathe themselves in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their
    abominations.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Then they will know that I am the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>; I have not said in vain that I would inflict this disaster on them.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> &ldquo;This
    is what
    the Lord <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5222-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5222-1">e</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span> says: &lsquo;Clap
    your
    hands, stamp your foot and say, &ldquo;Woe, because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, which will
    fall
    by the sword, famine, and plague!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small><i class="calibre12">Anyone</i> who is far away will
    die by the plague, <i class="calibre12">anyone</i> who is near will fall by the sword, and <i
      class="calibre12">anyone</i> who remains and is spared <i class="calibre12">from these</i> will die by the famine.
    So I will expend My wrath on them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Then you will know that I am the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, when their dead are among their idols around their altars, on every high hill, on all
    the tops of the mountains, under every leafy tree and under every massive oak with thick branchesâ€”the places where
    they offered a soothing aroma to all their idols.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>So through all their dwelling places I will stretch out
    My hand against them and make the land more desolate and waste than the wilderness toward Diblah; so they will know
    that I am the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
