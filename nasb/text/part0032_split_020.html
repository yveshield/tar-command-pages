  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Adulterous Woman</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And early in the morning He came again into the temple
    <i class="calibre12">area,</i> and all the people were coming to Him; and He sat down and <i
      class="calibre12">began</i> teaching them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Now the scribes and the Pharisees *brought a woman
    caught in the act of adultery, and after placing her in the center <i class="calibre12">of the courtyard,</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>they *said to Him, &ldquo;Teacher, this woman has been
    caught
    in the very act of committing adultery.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now in the Law, Moses commanded us to stone such women;
    what then do You say?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now they were saying this to test Him, so that they
    might have <i class="calibre12">grounds for</i> accusing Him. But Jesus stooped down and with His finger wrote on
    the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>When they persisted in asking Him, He straightened up
    and said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him <i class="calibre12">be the</i> first to throw a
    stone
    at her.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now when they heard <i class="calibre12">this,</i> they
    <i class="calibre12">began</i> leaving, one by one, beginning with the older ones, and He was left alone, and the
    woman <i class="calibre12">where she</i> was, in the center <i class="calibre12">of the courtyard.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>And straightening up, Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Woman,
    where
    are they? Did no one condemn you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>She said, &ldquo;No one, <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6561-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6561-1">a</a></sup></small>Lord.&rdquo; And Jesus said, &ldquo;I do not condemn
    you,
    either. Go. From now on do not sin any longer.&rdquo;<b class="calibre9">]]</b>

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus Is the Light of the World</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">12</b></span> Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, &ldquo;I am the Light
    of
    the world; the one who follows Me will not walk in the darkness, but will have the Light of life.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So the Pharisees said to Him, &ldquo;You are testifying
    about
    Yourself; Your testimony is not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6562-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6562-1">b</a></sup></small>true.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Jesus answered and said to them, &ldquo;Even if I am
    testifying about Myself, My testimony is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6562-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6562-2">c</a></sup></small>true, because I know where I
    came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>You judge <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6562-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6562-3">d</a></sup></small>according to the flesh; I am not judging anyone.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But even if I do judge, My judgment is true; for I am
    not alone <i class="calibre12">in it,</i> but I and the Father who sent Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Even in your Law it has been written that the testimony
    of two people is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6562-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6562-4">e</a></sup></small>true.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>I am He who testifies about Myself, and the Father who
    sent Me testifies about Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So they were saying to Him, &ldquo;Where is Your
    Father?&rdquo;
    Jesus answered, &ldquo;You know neither Me nor My Father; if you knew Me, you would know My Father also.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>These words He spoke <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6562-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6562-5">f</a></sup></small>in the treasury, as He taught in the temple <i
      class="calibre12">area;</i> and no one arrested Him, because His hour had not yet come.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then He said
    again to them, &ldquo;I am going away, and you will look for Me, and will die in your sin; where I am going, you
    cannot
    come.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So the Jews were saying, &ldquo;Surely He will not kill
    Himself, will He, since He says, &lsquo;Where I am going, you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And He was saying to them, &ldquo;You are from below, I
    am
    from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins;
    for unless you believe that <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6563-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6563-1">g</a></sup></small>I am, you will die in your sins.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then they were saying to Him, &ldquo;Who are
    You?&rdquo;
    Jesus said
    to them, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6563-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6563-2">h</a></sup></small>What have I even been saying to you <i
      class="calibre12">from</i> the beginning?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>I have many things to say and to judge regarding you,
    but He who sent Me is true; and the things which I heard from Him, these I say to the world.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>They did not realize that He was speaking to them <i
      class="calibre12">about</i> the Father.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So Jesus said, &ldquo;When you lift up the Son of Man,
    then
    you will know that <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6563-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6563-3">i</a></sup></small>I am, and I do nothing <small class="small1"><sup

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6563-4">j</a></sup></small>on My own, but I say these things as the Father
    instructed Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And He who sent Me is with Me; He <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6563-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6563-5">k</a></sup></small>has not left Me alone, for I always do the things
    that are pleasing to Him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>As He said these things, many came to believe in Him.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Truth Will Set You Free</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed Him,
    &ldquo;If
    you continue in My word, <i class="calibre12">then</i> you are truly My disciples;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you
    free.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>They answered Him, &ldquo;We are Abraham&rsquo;s
    descendants
    and
    have never been enslaved to anyone; how <i class="calibre12">is it that</i> You say, &lsquo;You will become
    free&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">34</b></span> Jesus
    answered them, &ldquo;Truly, truly I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>Now the slave does not remain in the house forever; the
    son does remain forever.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>So if the Son sets you free, you really will be free.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>I know that you are Abraham&rsquo;s descendants; yet
    you are
    seeking to kill Me, because My word <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6564-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0033_split_009.html#f6564-1">l</a></sup></small>has no place in you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>I speak of the things which I have seen <small

          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6564-2">m</a></sup></small>with <i class="calibre12">My</i> Father; therefore
    you also do the things which you heard from <i class="calibre12">your</i> father.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">39</b></span> They answered
    and said to Him, &ldquo;Abraham is our father.&rdquo; Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;If you are Abraham&rsquo;s
    children, do
    the
    deeds of
    Abraham.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has
    told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>You are doing the deeds of your father.&rdquo; They
    said to
    Him, &ldquo;We were not born as a result of sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>Jesus said to them, &ldquo;If God were your Father, you

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">47</sup></small>The one who is of God hears the words of God; for this

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">48</b></span> The Jews
    answered and said to Him, &ldquo;Do we not rightly say that You are a Samaritan, and You have a demon?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">49</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;I do not have a demon; on the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>But I am not seeking My glory; there is One who seeks

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">53</sup></small>You are not greater than our father Abraham, who died,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">54</sup></small>Jesus answered, &ldquo;If I glorify Myself, My glory is

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">55</sup></small>and you have not come to know Him, but I know Him. And
