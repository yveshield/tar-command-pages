  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Vision of Abominations in Jerusalem</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it came about in the sixth year, on the fifth <i
      class="calibre12">day</i> of the sixth month, as I was sitting in my house with the elders of Judah sitting before
    me, that the hand of the Lord <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5228-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5228-1">a</a></sup></small>G<span class="small1">OD</span> fell upon me there.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then I looked, and behold, something like the appearance
    of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5228-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5228-2">b</a></sup></small>a man; from His waist and downward <i
      class="calibre12">there was</i> the appearance of fire, and from His waist and upward like the appearance of a
    glow, like gleaming <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5228-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5228-3">c</a></sup></small>metal.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And He extended the form of a hand and took me by the
    hair of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to
    Jerusalem, to the entrance of the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5228-4"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0027_split_013.html#f5228-4">d</a></sup></small>north gate of the inner <i
      class="calibre12">courtyard,</i> where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, <i
      class="calibre12">was located.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel <i
      class="calibre12">was</i> there, like the appearance which I saw in the plain.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> Then He said
    to me, &ldquo;Son of man, raise your eyes now toward the north.&rdquo; So I raised my eyes toward the north, and
    behold,
    to the
    north of the altar gate <i class="calibre12">was</i> this idol of jealousy at the entrance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>And He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, do you see what
    they are
    doing, the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, so that I would be far from My
    sanctuary? But yet you will see still greater abominations!&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Then He
    brought me to the entrance of the courtyard, and when I looked, behold, a hole in the wall.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, now dig through
    the
    wall.&rdquo; So I dug through the wall, and behold, an entrance.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then He said to me, &ldquo;Go in and see the wicked
    abominations that they are committing here.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of
    crawling things and animals <i class="calibre12">and</i> detestable things, with all the idols of the house of
    Israel, were carved on the wall all around.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>And standing in front of them were seventy elders of
    the house of Israel, with Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan standing among them, each man <i class="calibre12">with</i>
    his censer in his hand; and the fragrance of the cloud of incense was rising.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>Then He said to me, &ldquo;Do you see, son of man, what
    the
    elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, each man in the rooms of his carved images? For they say,
    &lsquo;The
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> does not see us; the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has abandoned the
    land.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>And He said to me, &ldquo;Yet you will see still
    greater
    abominations which they are committing!&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> Then He
    brought me to the entrance of the gate of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    house
    which <i class="calibre12">was</i> toward the north; and behold, women were sitting there weeping for <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And He said to me, &ldquo;Do you see <i
      class="calibre12">this,</i> son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these!&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then He
    brought me into the inner courtyard of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    house. And
    behold, at the entrance to the temple of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, between the porch and the altar, <i
      class="calibre12">were</i> about twenty-five men <i class="calibre12">with</i> their backs to the temple of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> while their faces were toward the east; and they were <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source5230-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5230-1">f</a></sup></small>prostrating themselves eastward toward the sun.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>And He said to me, &ldquo;Do you see <i
      class="calibre12">this,</i> son of man? Is it a trivial thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations
    which they have committed here, that they have filled the land with violence and provoked Me to anger repeatedly?
    Yet behold, they are <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source5230-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0027_split_013.html#f5230-2">g</a></sup></small>putting the twig to their nose!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Therefore, I indeed will deal in wrath. My eye will
    have no pity nor will I spare; and though they cry out in My ears with a loud voice, yet I will not listen to
    them.&rdquo;
