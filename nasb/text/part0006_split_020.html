  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Balak Sends for Balaam</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the sons of Israel journeyed on, and camped in the plains
    of Moab beyond the Jordan <i class="calibre12">opposite</i> Jericho.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">2</b></span> Now Balak the
    son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So Moab was in great fear because of the people, for
    they were numerous; and Moab was in dread of the sons of Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Moab said to the elders of Midian, &ldquo;Now this
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source743-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f743-1">a</a></sup></small>horde will eat up all that is around us, as the ox
    eats up the grass of the field!&rdquo; And Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, at
    Pethor, which is near the <i class="calibre12">Euphrates</i> River, <i class="calibre12">in</i> the land of the sons
    of his people, to call for him, saying, &ldquo;Behold, a people came out of Egypt; behold, they have covered the
    surface
    of the land, and they are living opposite me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>Now, therefore, please come, curse this people for me
    since they are too <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source743-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f743-2">b</a></sup></small>mighty for me; perhaps I will be able to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source743-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f743-3">c</a></sup></small>defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I
    know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> So the elders
    of Moab and the elders of Midian left with the <i class="calibre12">fees for</i> divination in their hands; and they
    came to Balaam and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source744-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f744-1">d</a></sup></small>repeated Balak&rsquo;s words to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And he said to them, &ldquo;Spend the night here, and I
    will
    bring word back to you just as the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> may speak to me.&rdquo; And the leaders of Moab
    stayed
    with Balaam.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then God came to Balaam and said, &ldquo;Who are these
    men
    with you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>Balaam said to God, &ldquo;Balak the son of Zippor,
    king of
    Moab, sent <i class="calibre12">word</i> to me:
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>&lsquo;Behold, there is a people who came out of Egypt,
    and
    they cover the surface of the land; now come, curse them for me; perhaps I will be able to fight against them and
    drive them out.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But God said to Balaam, &ldquo;Do not go with them; you
    shall
    not curse the people, for they are blessed.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>So Balaam got up in the morning and said to
    Balak&rsquo;s
    representatives, &ldquo;Go <i class="calibre12">back</i> to your land, for the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has
    refused to let me go with you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And the representatives from Moab got up and went to
    Balak, and said, &ldquo;Balaam refused to come with us.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">15</b></span> Then Balak
    sent representatives once again, more numerous and more distinguished than <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source745-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f745-1">e</a></sup></small>the previous.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>They came to Balaam and said to him, &ldquo;This is
    what
    Balak the son of Zippor says: &lsquo;I beg you, let nothing keep you from coming to me;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>for I will indeed honor you richly, and I will do
    whatever you tell me. Please come then, curse this people for me.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But Balaam replied to the servants of Balak, &ldquo;<i
      class="calibre12">Even</i> if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do <i
      class="calibre12">anything, either</i> small or great, contrary to the <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source745-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f745-2">f</a></sup></small>command of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> my
    God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find
    out what else the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will say to me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>And God came to Balaam at night and said to him,
    &ldquo;If
    the men have come to call you, rise <i class="calibre12">and</i> go with them; but you shall do only the thing that
    I tell you.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> So Balaam
    arose in the morning, saddled his donkey, and went with the leaders of Moab.
  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Angel and Balaam</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>But God was angry that he was going, and the angel of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> took his stand in the road as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on
    his donkey, and his two servants were with him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>When the donkey saw the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> standing in the road with his sword drawn in his hand, the donkey turned off from the
    road and went into the field; and Balaam struck the donkey to guide her back onto the road.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, <i class="calibre12">with</i> a stone wall on this side and on that side.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>When the donkey saw the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, she pressed herself against the wall and pressed Balaam&rsquo;s foot against the wall,
    so he
    struck her again.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no way to turn to the right or to the left.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>When the donkey saw the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, she lay down under Balaam; so Balaam was angry and struck the donkey with his staff.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> opened the
    mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, &ldquo;What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three
    times?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>And Balaam said to the donkey, &ldquo;<i
      class="calibre12">It
      is</i> because you have made a mockery of me! If only there had been a sword in my hand! For I would have killed
    you by now!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>But the donkey said to Balaam, &ldquo;Am I not your
    donkey on
    which you have ridden all your life to this day? Have I ever been in the habit of doing such a thing to you?&rdquo;
    And he
    said, &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">31</b></span> Then the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> opened Balaam&rsquo;s eyes, and he saw the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>
    standing in the way with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source746-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0007_split_006.html#f746-1">g</a></sup></small>all the way to
    the ground.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>Then the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to him, &ldquo;Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out as an adversary,
    because
    your way was reckless <i class="calibre12">and</i> contrary to me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>But the donkey saw me and turned away from me these
    three times. If she had not turned away from me, I certainly would have killed you just now, and let her
    live.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>So Balaam said to the angel of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, &ldquo;I have sinned, for I did not know that you were standing in the way against me.
    Now
    then, if it is displeasing to you, I will turn back.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>But the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to Balaam, &ldquo;Go with the men, but you shall speak only the word that I <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source746-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f746-2">h</a></sup></small>tell you.&rdquo; So Balaam went along with the
    representatives of Balak.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">36</b></span> When Balak
    heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the Arnon border, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source747-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0007_split_006.html#f747-1">i</a></sup></small>at the extreme end of the border.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Then Balak said to Balaam, &ldquo;Did I not urgently
    send <i class="calibre12">word</i> to you to call for you? Why did you not come to me? Am I really unable to honor
    you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>So Balaam said to Balak, &ldquo;Behold, I have come to
    you
    now! Am I really able to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that <i class="calibre12">only</i>
    shall I speak.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to
    Kiriath-huzoth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent <i
      class="calibre12">some</i> to Balaam and the leaders who were with him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">41</b></span> Then it came
    about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
