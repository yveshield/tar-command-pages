  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now Moab broke with Israel after the death of Ahab.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>And Ahaziah fell through the <i
      class="calibre12">window</i> lattice in his upper chamber which <i class="calibre12">was</i> in Samaria, and
    became ill. So he sent messengers and said to them, &ldquo;Go, inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, whether I
    will
    recover from this sickness.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>But the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to Elijah the Tishbite, &ldquo;Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and say to them,
    &lsquo;Is
    it
    because there is no God in Israel <i class="calibre12">that</i> you are going to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of
    Ekron?&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Now therefore, this is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1699-1"

    bed upon which you have lain, but you shall certainly die.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; Then Elijah departed.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">5</b></span> When the
    messengers returned to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1700-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1700-1">b</a></sup></small>Ahaziah, he said to them, &ldquo;<small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>They said to him, &ldquo;A man came up to meet us and
    said to
    us, &lsquo;Go, return to the king who sent you and say to him, &ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>
    says:
    &lsquo;Is it because there is no God in Israel <i class="calibre12">that</i> you are sending <i
      class="calibre12">messengers</i> to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron? Therefore <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1700-3" epub:type="noteref"

    have lain, but you shall certainly die.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then he said to them, &ldquo;What <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1700-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0013_split_012.html#f1700-4">e</a></sup></small>did the man look like, who came up to meet you and
    spoke these words to you?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And they said to him, &ldquo;<i class="calibre12">He
      was</i> a
    hairy man with a leather <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1700-5" epub:type="noteref"

    &ldquo;It
    is
    Elijah the Tishbite.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">9</b></span> Then <i
      class="calibre12">the king</i> sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty <i class="calibre12">men.</i> And he
    went up to him, and behold, he was sitting on the top of the hill. And he said to him, &ldquo;You man of God, the
    king
    says, &lsquo;Come down.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>But Elijah replied to the captain of fifty, &ldquo;If I
    am a
    man of God, may fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&rdquo; Then fire came down from heaven
    and
    consumed him and his fifty <i class="calibre12">men.</i>
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> So <i
      class="calibre12">the king</i> again sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty <i
      class="calibre12">men.</i> And he said to him, &ldquo;You man of God, this is what the king says: &lsquo;Come down
    quickly!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>But Elijah replied to them, &ldquo;If I am a man of
    God, may
    fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty.&rdquo; Then the fire of God came down from heaven and
    consumed
    him and his fifty <i class="calibre12">men.</i>
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> So <i
      class="calibre12">the king</i> again sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty <i
      class="calibre12">men.</i> When the third captain of fifty went up, he came and bowed down on his knees before
    Elijah, and begged him and said to him, &ldquo;You man of God, please let my life and the lives of these fifty
    servants of
    yours be precious in your sight.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Behold, fire came down from heaven and consumed the
    first two captains of fifty with their fifties; but now let my <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>And the angel of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to Elijah, &ldquo;Go down with him; do not be afraid of him.&rdquo; So he got up and went down with him to the
    king.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>Then he said to him, &ldquo;This is what the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> says: &lsquo;Since you have sent messengers to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of
    Ekronâ€”is it
    because there is no God in Israel to inquire of His word? Therefore <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
