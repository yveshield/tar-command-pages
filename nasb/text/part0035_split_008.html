    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>The one who speaks in a tongue edifies himself; but the
    one who prophesies edifies the church.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues, but rather
    that you would prophesy; and greater is the one who prophesies than the one who speaks in tongues, unless he
    interprets, so that the church may receive edification.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> But now,
    brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I
    speak to you either by way of revelation, or of knowledge, or of prophecy, or of teaching?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Yet <i class="calibre12">even</i> lifeless <i
      class="calibre12">instruments,</i> whether flute or harp, in producing a sound, if they do not produce a
    distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is played on the flute or on the harp?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>For if the trumpet produces an indistinct sound, who
    will prepare himself for battle?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So you too, unless you produce intelligible speech by
    the tongue, how will it be known what is spoken? For you will <i class="calibre12">just</i> be talking to the air.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>There are, perhaps, a great many kinds of <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6943-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_010.html#f6943-1">d</a></sup></small>languages in the world, and none is incapable of
    meaning.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will
    be unintelligible to the one who speaks, and the one who speaks will be unintelligible <small class="small1"><sup

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Therefore,
    one who speaks in a tongue is to pray that he may interpret.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind
    is unproductive.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>What is <i class="calibre12">the outcome</i> then? I
    will pray with the spirit, but I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit, but I will sing with the
    mind also.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>For you are giving thanks well <i
      class="calibre12">enough,</i> but the other person is not edified.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>I thank God, I speak in tongues more than you all;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>nevertheless, in church I prefer to speak five words
    with my mind so that I may instruct others also, rather than ten thousand words in a tongue.

  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters,</i> do not be
    children in your thinking; yet in evil be infants, but in your thinking be mature.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>In the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6945-1" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_010.html#f6945-1">i</a></sup></small>Law it is

    M<span class="small1">E</span>,&rdquo; says the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>So then, tongues are for a sign, not to those who
    believe but to unbelievers; but prophecy is not for unbelievers, but for those who believe.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Therefore if the whole church gathers together and all
    <i class="calibre12">the people</i> speak in tongues, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are insane?

    called to account by all;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so he will
    fall on his face and worship God, declaring that God is certainly among you.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">26</b></span> What is <i
      class="calibre12">the outcome</i> then, brothers <i class="calibre12">and sisters?</i> When you assemble, each one
    has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. All things are to be done for
    edification.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>If anyone speaks in a tongue, <i class="calibre12">it
      must be</i> by two or at the most three, and <i class="calibre12">each one</i> in turn, and one is to interpret;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>but if there is no interpreter, he is to keep silent in
    church; and have him speak to himself and to God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>Have two or three prophets speak, and have the others
    pass judgment.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>But if a revelation is made to another who is seated,
    then the first one is to keep silent.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>for God is not <i class="calibre12">a God</i> of
    confusion, but of peace.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>the women are to keep silent in the churches; for they
    are not permitted to speak, but are to subject themselves, just as the Law also says.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their
    own husbands at home; for it is <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6947-2"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Or was it from you that the word of God <i

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">37</b></span> If anyone
    thinks that he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I write to you are the
