  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Again Spares Saul</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, &ldquo;Is
    David
    not keeping himself hidden on the hill of Hachilah, <i class="calibre12">which is</i> opposite <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1391-1" epub:type="noteref"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So Saul set out and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1391-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1391-2">b</a></sup></small>taking with him three thousand chosen men of Israel,
    to search for David in the wilderness of Ziph.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>And Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is
    opposite <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1391-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1391-3">c</a></sup></small>Jeshimon, beside the road, and David was staying in
    the wilderness. When he saw that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>David sent out spies, and he learned that Saul was
    definitely coming.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>David then set out and came to the place where Saul had
    camped. And David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was
    lying in the circle of the camp, and the people were camped around him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Then David
    said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab&rsquo;s brother, saying, &ldquo;Who will go
    down
    with me
    to Saul in the camp?&rdquo; And Abishai said, &ldquo;I will go down with you.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>So David and Abishai came to the people by night, and
    behold, Saul lay sleeping inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner
    and the people were lying around him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Then Abishai said to David, &ldquo;Today God has handed
    your
    enemy over to you; now then, please let me <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1392-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1392-1">d</a></sup></small>pin him with the spear to the
    ground with one thrust, and I will not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1392-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0010_split_027.html#f1392-2">e</a></sup></small>do it to him a second
    time.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But David said to Abishai, &ldquo;Do not <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1392-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1392-3">f</a></sup></small>kill him, for who can reach out with his hand
    against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointed and remain
    innocent?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>David also said, &ldquo;As the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> lives, the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> certainly will strike him, or his day will
    come that he dies, or he will go down in battle and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> forbid that I
    would reach out with my hand against the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span>
    anointed!
    But now please take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>So David took the spear and the jug of water <i
      class="calibre12">that were</i> at Saul&rsquo;s head, and they left; and no one saw or knew <i
      class="calibre12">about
      it,</i> nor did anyone awaken, for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had fallen on them.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">13</b></span> Then David
    crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the mountain at a distance <i class="calibre12">with</i> a large
    area between them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>And David called to the people and to Abner the son of
    Ner, saying, &ldquo;Will you not answer, Abner?&rdquo; Then Abner replied, &ldquo;Who are you who calls to the
    king?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>So David said to Abner, &ldquo;Are you not a man? And
    who is
    like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1393-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1393-1">h</a></sup></small>kill the king your lord!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>This thing that you have done is not good. As the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> lives, <i class="calibre12">all of</i> you undoubtedly <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1393-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1393-2">i</a></sup></small>must die, because you did not guard your lord, the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointed. And now, see where the king&rsquo;s
    spear is and
    the jug of water that was at his head!&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Then Saul
    recognized David&rsquo;s voice and said, &ldquo;Is this your voice, my son David?&rdquo; And David said, &ldquo;It
    is my
    voice,
    my lord the
    king.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>He also said, &ldquo;Why then is my lord pursuing his
    servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now then, please let my lord the king listen to the
    words of his servant. If the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has incited you against me, may He <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1394-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1394-1">j</a></sup></small>accept an offering; but if it is <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1394-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1394-2">k</a></sup></small>people, cursed <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1394-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1394-3">l</a></sup></small>are they before the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, because they have driven me out today so that I would have no share in the inheritance
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, saying, &lsquo;Go, serve other gods.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground far
    from the presence of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a
    single flea, just as one hunts a partridge in the mountains.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">21</b></span> Then Saul
    said, &ldquo;I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again since my life was precious in your
    sight
    this day. Behold, I have played the fool and have made a very great mistake.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>David replied, &ldquo;Behold, the spear of the king!
    Now have
    one of the young men come over and take it.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>And the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will repay
    each man <i class="calibre12">for</i> his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> handed you over to me today, but I refused to reach out with my hand against the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> anointed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Therefore behold, just as your life was highly valued
    in my sight this day, so may my life be highly valued in the sight of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and may
    He rescue me from all distress.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then Saul said to David, &ldquo;Blessed are you, my son
    David; you will both accomplish much and assuredly prevail.&rdquo; So David went on his way, and Saul returned to
    his
    place.
