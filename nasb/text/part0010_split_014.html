    his father&rsquo;s house.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he
    loved him as himself.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>But all Israel and Judah loved David, for he would go

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> Then Saul
    said to David, &ldquo;Here is my older daughter Merab; I will give her to you as a wife, only be a valiant man for
    me and
    fight the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>&rsquo;<span class="small1">S</span> battles.&rdquo; For Saul thought,
    &ldquo;My

    shall
    not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>But David said to Saul, &ldquo;Who am I, and who is my
    family, <i class="calibre12">or</i> my father&rsquo;s family in Israel, that I should be the king&rsquo;s
    son-in-law?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>So it came about at the time that Merab, Saul&rsquo;s
    daughter, was to be given to David, that she was given <i class="calibre12">instead</i> to Adriel the Meholathite as
    a wife.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David Marries Saul&rsquo;s Daughter</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Now Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved David. When they
    informed
    Saul, the thing was pleasing <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1353-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1353-1">o</a></sup></small>to him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>For Saul thought, &ldquo;I will give her to him so that
    she
    may become a trap for him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.&rdquo; Therefore Saul said to
    David,
    &ldquo;For a second time you may become my son-in-law, today.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Saul commanded his servants, &ldquo;Speak to David
    in
    secret, saying, &lsquo;Behold, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the
    king&rsquo;s
    son-in-law.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>So Saul&rsquo;s servants spoke these words <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1353-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1353-2">p</a></sup></small>to David. But David said, &ldquo;Is it trivial in
    your
    sight to become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law, since I am <i class="calibre12">only</i> a poor man and
    insignificant?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then Saul&rsquo;s servants reported to him, saying,
    &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1353-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1353-3">q</a></sup></small>These are the words David spoke.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Saul then said, &ldquo;This is what you shall say to
    David:
    &lsquo;The king does not desire any dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the
    king&rsquo;s
    enemies.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; But Saul plotted to have David fall by the hand of the Philistines.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>When his servants told David these words, <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1353-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1353-4">r</a></sup></small>it pleased David to become the king&rsquo;s
    son-in-law. So
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1353-5" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1353-5">s</a></sup></small>before the time had expired,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>David set out and went, he and his men, and fatally
    struck two hundred men among the Philistines. Then David brought their foreskins, and they presented all <i
      class="calibre12">two hundred</i> of them to the king, so that he might become the king&rsquo;s son-in-law. And
    Saul
    gave him his daughter Michal as a wife.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>When Saul saw and realized that the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> was with David, and <i class="calibre12">that</i> Michal, Saul&rsquo;s daughter, loved
    him,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>then Saul was even more afraid of David. So Saul was
    David&rsquo;s enemy continually.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Then the
    commanders of the Philistines went <i class="calibre12">to battle,</i> and it happened as often as they went out,
    that David was more <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1354-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0010_split_027.html#f1354-1">t</a></sup></small>successful than all the servants of Saul. So his
    name was held in high esteem.
