    words of the covenant which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in
    the land of Moab, besides the covenant which He had made with them at Horeb.

    &ldquo;You
    have seen all that the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and all
    his servants, and to all his land;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>the great trials which your eyes have seen, those great
    signs and wonders.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>Yet to this day the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> has
    not given you a heart to know, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>And I have led you in the wilderness for forty years;
    your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandal has not worn out on your foot.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or <i
      class="calibre12">other</i> strong drink, in order that you might know that I am the L<span

    place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us for battle, but we <small

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>So you will keep the words of this covenant and do them,
    in order that you may be successful in everything that you do.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>And it shall be when he hears the words of this curse,
    that he will consider himself fortunate in his heart, saying, &lsquo;I will do well though I walk in the

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>The L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will not be

    heaven.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will single
    him out for disaster from all the tribes of Israel, in accordance with all the curses of the covenant which is
    written in this Book of the Law.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">22</b></span> &ldquo;Now
    the
    future generation, your sons who rise up after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see

    say,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>&lsquo;All its land is brimstone and salt, burned

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source976-1" epub:type="noteref"

    like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> overthrew in
    His anger and in His wrath.&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>All the nations will say, &lsquo;Why has the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">25</sup></small>Then <i class="calibre12">people</i> will say,
    &lsquo;<i class="calibre12">It is</i> because they abandoned the covenant of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>,
    the God
    of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And they went and served other gods and worshiped them,
    gods that they have not known and whom He had not <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source976-3"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>Therefore, the anger of the L<span

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>and the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> uprooted them
    from their land in anger, fury, and in great wrath, and hurled them into another land, as <i class="calibre12">it
      is</i> this day.&rsquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">29</b></span> &ldquo;The
    secret
    things belong to the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> our God, but the things revealed belong to us and to our sons
    forever, so that we may <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source977-1" epub:type="noteref"
