  <div class="block">Do not leave us!&rdquo;</div>
  <p class="aleft"><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> This is what the L<span

    call their sins to account.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me,

    not pray for a good outcome on behalf of this people.

    those
    prophets
    shall meet their end!
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>And the people to whom they are prophesying will be
