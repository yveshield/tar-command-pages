  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Jesus Teaches at the Feast</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> After these things Jesus was walking in Galilee, for He was
    unwilling to walk in Judea because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Now the feast of the Jews, the Feast of Booths, was
    near.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>So His brothers said to Him, &ldquo;Move on from here
    and go
    into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see Your works which You are doing.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For no one does anything in secret <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6554-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6554-1">a</a></sup></small>when he himself is striving to be <i
      class="calibre12">known</i> publicly. If You are doing these things, show Yourself to the world.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>For not even His brothers believed in Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So Jesus *said to them, &ldquo;My time is not yet here,
    but
    your time is always ready.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I
    testify about it, that its deeds are evil.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>Go up to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this
    feast, because My time has not yet fully arrived.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Now having said these things to them, He stayed in
    Galilee.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">10</b></span> But when His
    brothers had gone up to the feast, then He Himself also went up, not publicly, but as <i
      class="calibre12">though</i> in secret.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>So the Jews were looking for Him at the feast and
    saying, &ldquo;Where is He?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And there was a great deal of talk about Him in secret
    among the crowds: some were saying, &ldquo;He is a good man&rdquo;; others were saying, &ldquo;No, on the contrary,
    He is
    misleading
    the people.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>However, no one was speaking openly about Him, for fear
    of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6555-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6555-1">b</a></sup></small>the Jews.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">14</b></span> But when it
    was now the middle of the feast, Jesus went up into the temple <i class="calibre12">area,</i> and <i
      class="calibre12">began to</i> teach.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>The Jews then were astonished, saying, &ldquo;How has
    this
    man become learned, not having been educated?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Jesus answered them and said, &ldquo;My teaching is
    not My
    own, but His who sent Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>If anyone is willing to do His will, he will know about
    the teaching, whether it is of God, or I am speaking from Myself.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>The one who speaks from himself seeks his own glory;
    but He who is seeking the glory of the One who sent Him, He is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">19</b></span> &ldquo;Did
    Moses
    not give you the Law, and <i class="calibre12">yet</i> none of you carries out the Law? Why are you seeking to kill
    Me?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>The crowd answered, &ldquo;You have a demon! Who is
    seeking
    to kill You?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Jesus answered them, &ldquo;I did one <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6556-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6556-1">c</a></sup></small>deed, and you all are astonished.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For this reason Moses has given you circumcision (not
    that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and <i class="calibre12">even</i> on a Sabbath you circumcise a man.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>If a man receives circumcision on a Sabbath so that the
    Law of Moses will not be broken, are you angry at Me because I made an entire man well on a Sabbath?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Do not judge by the outward appearance, but judge
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6556-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6556-2">d</a></sup></small>with righteous judgment.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> So some of
    the people of Jerusalem were saying, &ldquo;Is this man not the one whom they are seeking to kill?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">yet</i> look, He is speaking
    publicly, and they are saying nothing to Him. The rulers do not really know that this is the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6557-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6557-1">e</a></sup></small>Christ, do they?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>However, we know where this man is from; but when the
    Christ comes, no one knows where He is from.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and
    saying, &ldquo;You both know Me and you know where I am from; and I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is
    true,
    whom you do not know.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>I do know Him, because I am from Him, and He sent
    Me.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">30</sup></small>So they were seeking to arrest Him; and <i
      class="calibre12">yet</i> no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>But many of the crowd believed in Him; and they were
    saying, &ldquo;When the <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6557-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6557-2">f</a></sup></small>Christ comes, He will not perform more <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6557-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6557-3">g</a></sup></small>signs than those which this man has done, will
    He?&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">32</b></span> The Pharisees
    heard the crowd whispering these things about Him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest
    Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Therefore Jesus said, &ldquo;For a little while longer
    I am
    <i class="calibre12">going to be</i> with you, and <i class="calibre12">then</i> I am going to Him who sent Me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>You will seek Me, and will not find Me; and where I am,
    you cannot come.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>The Jews then said to one another, &ldquo;Where does
    this man
    intend to go that we will not find Him? He does not intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks, and teach the
    Greeks, does He?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>What is this statement that He said, &lsquo;You will
    seek Me,
    and will not find Me; and where I am, you cannot come&rsquo;?&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">37</b></span> Now on the
    last day, the great <i class="calibre12">day</i> of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone
    is
    thirsty, <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6558-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6558-1">h</a></sup></small>let him come to Me and drink.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>The one who believes in Me, as the Scripture said,
    &lsquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6558-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6558-2">i</a></sup></small>From his innermost being will flow rivers of living
    water.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>But this He said in reference to the Spirit, whom those
    who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not yet <i class="calibre12">given,</i> because Jesus was
    not yet glorified.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">People&rsquo;s Division over Jesus</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">40</b></span> <i class="calibre12">Some</i> of the people therefore, after
    they heard these words, were saying, &ldquo;This truly is the Prophet.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">41</sup></small>Others were saying, &ldquo;This is the <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6559-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6559-1">j</a></sup></small>Christ.&rdquo; But others were saying, &ldquo;Surely
    the
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6559-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0033_split_009.html#f6559-1">j</a></sup></small>Christ is not coming from Galilee, is He?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>Has the Scripture not said that the Christ comes from
    the descendants of David, and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">43</sup></small>So a dissension occurred in the crowd because of Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>And some of them wanted to arrest Him, but no one laid
    hands on Him.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">45</b></span> The officers
    then came to the chief priests and Pharisees, and they said to them, &ldquo;Why did you not bring Him?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">46</sup></small>The officers answered, &ldquo;Never has a man spoken in
    this
    way!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">47</sup></small>The Pharisees then replied to them, &ldquo;You have not
    been
    led astray too, have you?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">48</sup></small>Not one of the rulers or Pharisees has believed in Him,
    has he?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">49</sup></small>But this crowd that does not know the Law is
    accursed!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">50</sup></small>Nicodemus (the one who came to Him before, being one of
    them) *said to them,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">51</sup></small>&ldquo;Our Law does not judge the person unless it
    first
    hears from him and knows what he is doing, does it?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">52</sup></small>They answered and said to him, &ldquo;You are not from
    Galilee as well, are you? Examine <i class="calibre12">the Scriptures,</i> and see that no prophet arises out of
    Galilee.&rdquo;
