    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> The hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> was upon me,

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>He had me pass among them all around, and behold, <i
      class="calibre12">there were</i> very many on the surface of the valley; and behold, <i class="calibre12">they

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then He said to me, &ldquo;Son of man, can these bones

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> So I
    prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a <i class="calibre12">loud</i> noise, and behold, a

    bone.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And I looked, and behold, tendons were on them, and
    flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Then He said to me, &ldquo;Prophesy to the breath,
    prophesy,
    son of man, and say to the breath, &lsquo;The Lord G<span class="small1">OD</span> says this: &ldquo;Come from the
    four
    winds,
    breath, and breathe on these slain, so that they come to life.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath
    entered them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army.
