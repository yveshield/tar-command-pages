  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> said to me:
    &ldquo;Go and buy yourself a linen undergarment and put it around your waist, but do not put it in water.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So I bought the undergarment in accordance with the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, and put it around my waist.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Then the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    came to me a second time, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&ldquo;Take the undergarment that you bought, which is
    around
    your waist, and arise, go to the Euphrates and hide it there in a crevice of the rock.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> had commanded me.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>After many days the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    said to me, &ldquo;Arise, go to the Euphrates and take from there the undergarment which I commanded you to hide
    there.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Then I went to the Euphrates and dug, and I took the
    undergarment from the place where I had hidden it; and behold, the undergarment was ruined, it was completely
    useless.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">8</b></span> Then the word
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to me, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>&ldquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    says:
    &lsquo;To the same extent I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>This wicked people, who refuse to listen to My words,
    who walk in the stubbornness of their hearts and have followed other gods to serve them and to bow down to them, let
    them be just like this undergarment which is completely useless.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>For as the undergarment clings to the waist of a man,
    so I made the entire household of Israel and the entire household of Judah cling to Me,&rsquo; declares the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, &lsquo;so that they might be My people, for <small class="small1"><sup

    what
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, the God of Israel says: &ldquo;Every jug is to be filled with

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>then say to them, &lsquo;This is what the L<span

    sit for
    David on his throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem—with drunkenness!
