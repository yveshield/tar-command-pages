  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> And it came about, when David lived in his house, that David
    said to Nathan the prophet, &ldquo;Look, I am living in a house of cedar, but the ark of the covenant of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> is under tent curtains.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>Then Nathan said to David, &ldquo;Do whatever is in your
    heart, for God is with you.&rdquo;
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">3</b></span> But it
    happened that same night, that the word of God came to Nathan, saying,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>&ldquo;Go and tell David My servant, &lsquo;This is what
    the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> says: &ldquo;You shall not build a house for Me to dwell in;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>for I have not dwelt in a house since the day that I
    brought up Israel to this day, but I have <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1919-1"

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>In all places where I have walked with all Israel, have
    I spoken a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people, saying, &lsquo;Why have
    you not
    built Me a house of cedar?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>Now, therefore, this is what you shall say to My servant
    David: &lsquo;This is what the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies says: &ldquo;I took you from the pasture,
    from
    following the sheep, to be leader over My people Israel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have
    eliminated all your enemies from you; and I will make for you a name like the name of the great ones who are on the
    earth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>And I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and
    will plant them <i class="calibre12">there,</i> so that they may live in their own place and not tremble <i

    not make them waste away anymore as <i class="calibre12">they did</i> previously,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>even from the day that I commanded judges <i
      class="calibre12">to be</i> over My people Israel. And I will subdue all your enemies.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><b class="calibre9">M</b>oreover, I tell you that the L<span

    throne forever.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>I will be his father and he shall be My son; and I will
    not take My favor away from him, as I took it from him who was before you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>But I will settle him in My house and in My kingdom
    forever, and his throne will be established forever.&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>According to all these words and according to all of
    this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.

  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">David&rsquo;s Prayer in Response</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Then King David came in and sat before the L<span

    that
    You have brought me this far?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>This was a small thing in Your eyes, God; but You have
    spoken of Your servant&rsquo;s house for a great while to come, and have viewed me according to the standard of a
    person
    of high degree, L<span class="small1">ORD</span> God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>What more can David still <i class="calibre12">say</i>
    to You concerning the honor <i class="calibre12">bestowed</i> on Your servant? For You know Your servant.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, for Your
    servant&rsquo;s
    sake, and according to Your own heart, You have accomplished all this greatness, to make known all these great
    things.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">20</sup></small>L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, there is none like
    You, nor is there any God besides You, according to everything that we have heard with our ears.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>And what one nation on the earth is like Your people
    Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself <i class="calibre12">as</i> a people, to make for You a name by great
    and awesome things, by driving out nations from before Your people, whom You redeemed from Egypt?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>For You have made Your people Israel Your own people
    forever, and You, L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, became their God.

    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>And now You have decided to bless the house of Your
