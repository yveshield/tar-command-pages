  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">The Temporal and Eternal</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> For we know that if our <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6977-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6977-1">a</a></sup></small>earthly tent which is our house is torn down, we
    have a building from God, a house not made by hands, eternal in the heavens.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>For indeed, in this <i class="calibre12">tent</i> we
    groan, longing to be clothed with our <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6977-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6977-2">b</a></sup></small>dwelling from heaven,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>since in fact after putting it on, we will not be found
    naked.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>For indeed, we who are in this tent groan, being
    burdened, because we do not want to be unclothed but to be clothed, so that what is mortal will be swallowed up by
    life.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Now He who prepared us for this very <i
      class="calibre12">purpose is</i> God, who gave us the Spirit as a <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6977-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6977-3">c</a></sup></small>pledge.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">6</b></span> Therefore,
    being always of good courage, and knowing that while we are at home in the body we are absent from the Lord—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">7</sup></small>for we walk by faith, not by <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source6978-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6978-1">d</a></sup></small>sight—
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>but we are of good courage and prefer rather to be
    absent from the body and to be at home with the Lord.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>Therefore we also have as our ambition, whether at home
    or absent, to be pleasing to Him.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of
    Christ, so that each one may receive compensation for <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6978-2" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6978-2">e</a></sup></small>his deeds <i
      class="calibre12">done</i> through the body, in accordance with what he has done, whether good or bad.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">11</b></span> Therefore,
    knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade people, but we are well known to God; and I hope that we are also well
    known in your consciences.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>We are not commending ourselves to you again, but <i
      class="calibre12">are</i> giving you an opportunity to be proud of us, so that you will have <i
      class="calibre12">an answer</i> for those who take pride in appearance and not in heart.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>For if we have lost our minds, <i class="calibre12">it
      is</i> for God; if we are of sound mind, <i class="calibre12">it is</i> for you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>For the love of Christ controls us, having concluded
    this, that one died for all, therefore all died;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>and He died for all, so that those who live would no
    longer live for themselves, but for Him who died and rose on their behalf.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">16</b></span> Therefore
    from now on we recognize no one <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6979-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6979-1">f</a></sup></small>by the flesh; even though we
    have known Christ by the flesh, yet now we know <i class="calibre12">Him in this way</i> no longer.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">17</sup></small>Therefore if anyone is in Christ, <i
      class="calibre12">this person is</i> a new <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6979-2"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6979-2">g</a></sup></small>creation; the old things passed
    away; behold, new things have come.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>Now all <i class="calibre12">these</i> things are from
    God, who reconciled us to Himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation,
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>namely, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to
    Himself, not counting their wrongdoings against them, and <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a
          id="source6979-3" epub:type="noteref" href="part0035_split_023.html#f6979-3">h</a></sup></small>He has <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6979-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6979-4">i</a></sup></small>committed to us the word of reconciliation.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> Therefore, we
    are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were making an appeal through us; we beg you on behalf of Christ, be
    reconciled to God.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>He made Him who knew no sin <i class="calibre12">to
      be</i> <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source6980-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0035_split_023.html#f6980-1">j</a></sup></small>sin in our behalf, so that we might become the
    righteousness of God in Him.
