    men into whose hands they gave the money to pay to those who did the work, because they acted faithfully.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>The money from the guilt offerings and the money from
    the sin offerings was not brought into the house of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; it belonged to the
