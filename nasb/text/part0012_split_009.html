  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Obadiah Meets Elijah</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">1</b></span> Now it happened <i class="calibre12">after</i> many days that
    the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> came to Elijah in the third year, saying, &ldquo;Go, present
    yourself to
    Ahab, and I will provide rain on the face of the earth.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">2</sup></small>So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab. Now the
    famine <i class="calibre12">was</i> severe in Samaria.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">3</sup></small>Ahab summoned Obadiah, who <i class="calibre12">was</i>
    in charge of the household. (Now Obadiah <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1665-1"
          epub:type="noteref" href="part0012_split_013.html#f1665-1">a</a></sup></small>feared the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> greatly;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">4</sup></small>for when Jezebel killed the prophets of the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave, and provided them
    with bread and water.)
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">5</sup></small>Then Ahab said to Obadiah, &ldquo;Go through the land to
    all
    the springs of water and to all the river valleys; perhaps we will find grass and keep the horses and mules alive,
    and not <i class="calibre12">have to</i> kill some of the cattle.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">6</sup></small>So they divided the land between them to <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1665-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1665-2">b</a></sup></small>survey it; Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah
    went another way by himself.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">7</b></span> Now as Obadiah
    was on the way, behold, Elijah met him, and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, &ldquo;Is it you,
    Elijah my
    master?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">8</sup></small>And he said to him, &ldquo;It is I. Go, say to your
    master,
    &lsquo;Behold, Elijah <i class="calibre12">is here.</i>&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">9</sup></small>But he said, &ldquo;What <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1666-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1666-1">c</a></sup></small>sin have I committed, that you are handing your
    servant over to Ahab, to put me to death?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">10</sup></small>As <i class="calibre12">surely as</i> the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom to which my master has not sent <i
      class="calibre12">word</i> to search for you; and whenever they say, &lsquo;He is not <i
      class="calibre12">here,</i>&rsquo; he
    makes the kingdom or nation swear that they could not find you.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">11</sup></small>Yet now you are saying, &lsquo;Go, say to your master,
    &ldquo;Behold, Elijah <i class="calibre12">is here!</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">12</sup></small>And it will come about when I leave you that the Spirit
    of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> will carry you to where I do not know; so when I come and inform Ahab and he
    cannot find you, he will kill me, though <i class="calibre12">I,</i> your servant, have <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1666-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1666-2">d</a></sup></small>feared the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> from my
    youth.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">13</sup></small>Has it not been reported to my master what I did when
    Jezebel killed the prophets of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, that I hid a hundred <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1666-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1666-3">e</a></sup></small>prophets of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> by
    fifties in a cave, and provided them with bread and water?
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">14</sup></small>Yet now you are saying, &lsquo;Go, say to your master,
    &ldquo;Behold, Elijah <i class="calibre12">is here</i>&rdquo;&nbsp;&rsquo;; he will then kill me!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">15</sup></small>Then Elijah said, &ldquo;As <i class="calibre12">surely
      as</i> the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> of armies lives, before whom I stand, I will certainly present myself
    to him today.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">16</sup></small>So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and informed him; then
    Ahab went to meet Elijah.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">17</b></span> When Ahab saw
    Elijah, Ahab said to him, &ldquo;Is this you, the cause of disaster to Israel?&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">18</sup></small>He said, &ldquo;I have not brought disaster to Israel,
    but
    you and your father&rsquo;s house <i class="calibre12">have,</i> because you have abandoned the commandments of the
    L<span class="small1">ORD</span> and you have followed the Baals.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">19</sup></small>Now then, send <i class="calibre12">orders and</i>
    gather to me all Israel at Mount Carmel, <i class="calibre12">together</i> with 450 prophets of Baal and four
    hundred prophets of <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1667-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1667-1">f</a></sup></small>the Asherah, who eat at Jezebel&rsquo;s
    table.&rdquo;

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">God or Baal on Mount Carmel</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">20</b></span> So Ahab sent <i class="calibre12">orders</i> among all the
    sons of Israel and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">21</sup></small>Then Elijah approached all the people and said,
    &ldquo;How
    long are you going to <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1668-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1668-1">g</a></sup></small>struggle with the two choices? If the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span> is God, follow Him; but if Baal, follow him.&rdquo; But the people did not answer him <i
      class="calibre12">so much as</i> a word.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">22</sup></small>Then Elijah said to the people, &ldquo;I alone am left
    as a
    prophet of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, while Baal&rsquo;s prophets are 450 men.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">23</sup></small>Now have them give us two oxen; and have them choose
    the one ox for themselves and cut it up, and place it on the wood, but put no fire <i class="calibre12">under
      it;</i> and I will prepare the other ox and lay it on the wood, and I will not put a fire <i
      class="calibre12">under it.</i>
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">24</sup></small>Then you call on the name of your god, and I will call
    on the name of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and the God who answers by fire, He is God.&rdquo; And all the
    people
    replied, &ldquo;<small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1668-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1668-2">h</a></sup></small>That is a good idea.&rdquo;

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">25</b></span> So Elijah
    said to the prophets of Baal, &ldquo;Choose the one ox for yourselves and prepare it first, since <i
      class="calibre12">there are</i> many <i class="calibre12">of</i> you, and call on the name of your god, but put no
    fire <i class="calibre12">under the ox.</i>&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">26</sup></small>Then they took the ox which <small class="small1"><sup
        class="calibre14"><a id="source1669-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1669-1">i</a></sup></small>was given them and they prepared it, and they called
    on the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, &ldquo;O Baal, answer us!&rdquo; But there was no voice and no
    one
    answered. And they <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1669-2" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1669-2">j</a></sup></small>limped about the altar which <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1669-3" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1669-3">k</a></sup></small>they had made.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">27</sup></small>And at noon Elijah ridiculed them and said, &ldquo;Call
    out
    with a loud voice, since he is a god; undoubtedly he is attending to business, or is on the way, or is on a journey.
    Perhaps he is asleep, and will awaken.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">28</sup></small>So they cried out with a loud voice, and cut themselves
    according to their custom with swords and lances until blood gushed out on them.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">29</sup></small>When midday was past, they raved until the time of the
    offering of the <i class="calibre12">evening</i> sacrifice; but there was no voice, no one answered, and <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1669-4" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1669-4">l</a></sup></small>no one paid attention.

    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">30</b></span> Then Elijah
    said to all the people, &ldquo;Come forward to me.&rdquo; So all the people came forward to him. And he repaired the
    altar
    of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> which had been torn down.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">31</sup></small>Then Elijah took twelve stones, corresponding to the
    number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span> had come,
    saying, &ldquo;Israel shall be your name.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">32</sup></small>And with the stones he built an altar in the name of
    the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>; and he made a trench around the altar, large enough to hold two <small
      class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1670-1" epub:type="noteref"
          href="part0012_split_013.html#f1670-1">m</a></sup></small>measures of seed.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">33</sup></small>Then he laid out the wood, and he cut the ox in pieces
    and placed <i class="calibre12">it</i> on the wood.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">34</sup></small>And he said, &ldquo;Fill four large jars with water and
    pour
    <i class="calibre12">it</i> on the burnt offering and on the wood.&rdquo; And he said, &ldquo;Do it a second
    time,&rdquo; so
    they did
    it a second time. Then he said, &ldquo;Do it a third time,&rdquo; so they did it a third time.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">35</sup></small>The water flowed around the altar, and he also filled
    the trench with water.

  </p>
  <p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre10" /></p>
  <p class="head2"><i class="calibre12">Elijah&rsquo;s Prayer</i></p>
  <p class="aleft">
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">36</sup></small>Then at the time of the offering of the <i
      class="calibre12">evening</i> sacrifice, Elijah the prophet approached and said, &ldquo;L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, today let it be known that You are God in Israel and
    that I am Your servant, and <i class="calibre12">that</i> I have done all these things at Your word.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">37</sup></small>Answer me, L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, answer me,
    so that this people may know that You, L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, are God, and <i class="calibre12">that</i>
    You have turned their heart back.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">38</sup></small>Then the fire of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood, and the stones and the dust; and it licked up the water that was
    in the trench.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">39</sup></small>When all the people saw <i class="calibre12">this,</i>
    they fell on their faces; and they said, &ldquo;The L<span class="small1">ORD</span>, He is God; the L<span
      class="small1">ORD</span>, He is God!&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">40</sup></small>Then Elijah said to them, &ldquo;Seize the prophets of
    Baal;
    do not let one of them escape.&rdquo; So they seized them; and Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon, and
    slaughtered them there.
    <br class="calibre10" /><br class="calibre10" /><span class="small1"><b class="calibre9">41</b></span> Now Elijah
    said to Ahab, &ldquo;Go up, eat and drink; for there is the sound of the roar of a <i class="calibre12">heavy</i>
    shower.&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">42</sup></small>So Ahab went up to eat and drink. But Elijah went up to
    the top of Carmel; and he bent down to the earth and put his face between his knees.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">43</sup></small>And he said to his servant, &ldquo;Go up now, look
    toward the
    sea.&rdquo; So he went up and looked, but he said, &ldquo;There is nothing.&rdquo; Yet <i
      class="calibre12">Elijah</i> said,
    &ldquo;Go back&rdquo;
    seven times.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">44</sup></small>And <i class="calibre12">when he returned</i> the
    seventh <i class="calibre12">time,</i> he said, &ldquo;Behold, a cloud as small as a person&rsquo;s hand is coming
    up from
    the
    sea.&rdquo; And <i class="calibre12">Elijah</i> said, &ldquo;Go up, say to Ahab, &lsquo;Harness <i
      class="calibre12">your

      horses</i> and go down, so that the <i class="calibre12">heavy</i> shower does not stop you.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">45</sup></small>Meanwhile the sky became dark with clouds and wind <i
      class="calibre12">came up,</i> and there was a heavy shower. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.
    <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14">46</sup></small>Then the hand of the L<span class="small1">ORD</span>
    was on Elijah, and he <small class="small1"><sup class="calibre14"><a id="source1671-1" epub:type="noteref"
